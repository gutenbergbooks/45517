<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="sc">My Dear Boys:</span> In bringing out this story,
&ldquo;The Putnam Hall Cadets,&rdquo; the initial volume
in the &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series,&rdquo; I feel it necessary
to make an explanation why it is that this tale is
brought out when I have already written so much
concerning the doings of the students at Putnam
Hall.</p>
<p>Ever since I presented to the boys the first volume
in the &ldquo;Rover Boys Series,&rdquo; I have been
urged by the boys&mdash;and girls, too, for the matter
of that&mdash;to write something concerning the doings
of the students at the Hall previous to the
coming of the Rover boys on the scene. When
the Rovers arrived they found a wide-awake, jolly
crowd of cadets already there, some of whom
had been at the academy several years. My
young friends wished to know more about these,
and it is for their benefit that I have instituted
this new series, which will tell of many things
that happened at the famous seat of learning from
the time it was first opened to the present day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">[vi]</div>
<p>Putnam Hall is an ideal boarding school for
boys, located on the shore of a beautiful lake in
upper New York State. The students there are
bright, manly fellows, full of vigor and fun, and
bound to get the best there is out of school life.
There are some keen rivalries, and in the story
are related the particulars of a mystery which
had an unlooked-for ending.</p>
<p>In offering this first book of the new series I
wish to thank the thousands everywhere who
have written to me regarding the &ldquo;Rover Boys
Series.&rdquo; It does my heart good to know that
the tales have been so well liked. I trust sincerely
that the present story meets with equal approbation.</p>

<h1 title="">THE PUTNAM HALL CADETS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">INTRODUCING SOME CADETS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, Jack, I&rsquo;ve got news! To-morrow
we are going to ballot for officers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; answered Jack
Ruddy, as he threw down the algebra he had been
studying. &ldquo;I was almost afraid we weren&rsquo;t
going to have officers this term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Captain Putnam wanted to find out
if there was any military material here before he
let us fellows take charge,&rdquo; went on Pepper Ditmore,
as he swung himself up on a corner of the
dormitory table. &ldquo;Tell you what, Jack, it&rsquo;s a
great thing to organize a school like this, and
get everything in working order, all in six
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you are organized, Pep?&rdquo; queried
Jack Ruddy, with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m organized about as much as I&rsquo;ll ever be,&rdquo;
returned Pepper Ditmore. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect a
fellow like me to settle down and be as quiet as
a lamb, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re more like a jumping-jack. The
fellows don&rsquo;t call you the Imp for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a base slander,&rdquo; returned Pepper Ditmore,
with an injured air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as meek, sometimes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circus clown. By the way, have they found
out yet who mixed the salt and sugar last Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as they have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who put that little bulldog in Josiah
Crabtree&rsquo;s bedroom in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t asked me about it,&rdquo; and now
Pepper Ditmore began to grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me congratulate you on your
escape,&rdquo; and Jack Ruddy smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s change the subject, Jack. Don&rsquo;t you
want to be an officer of the Putnam Hall Cadet
Corps? I should think that would just suit you.
Your father was an army officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would suit me first-rate. But the fellows
don&rsquo;t know much about me. Most of them are
strangers to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are mostly strangers to each
other. If you want to become an officer, say
the word and I&rsquo;ll do the electioneering for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to be an officer yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>At this question Pepper Ditmore gave a merry
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d make a fine-looking officer, wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
he returned. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll remain a high private
in the rear rank&mdash;and take my sport in some
other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect me to be an officer over you,
Pep? How in the world will I manage you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By not trying, Jack. But come, are you
going to be an officer or not? As a battalion,
we are to have a major, two captains, two first
lieutenants, two second lieutenants, and a lot of
sergeants and corporals. I want to see you a
captain at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather see you an officer than that Dan
Baxter. Do you know, Jack, I don&rsquo;t like that
chap at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more do I. He is very overbearing. I
heard him bossing some of the little fellows
around in regular slave-driver style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he shan&rsquo;t boss me around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not likely he&rsquo;ll bother the big boys,&rdquo;
came from Jack Ruddy, as he arose from his
chair and stretched himself. &ldquo;Those chaps
usually make the little fellows toady to them.
What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on down to the lake and have a
row before supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment something soft, thrown up
through the open dormitory window, struck Jack
Ruddy on the shirt bosom. It was a lump of
mud, and it left quite a mark behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there, who threw that?&rdquo; he cried,
angrily, as he rushed for the window. He was
just in time to see a lank youth diving out of
sight behind some bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that lad,&rdquo; came from Pepper Ditmore.
&ldquo;His name is John Fenwick, but they
call him Mumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Mumps him!&rdquo; retorted Jack Ruddy.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; And he rushed out of the dormitory,
and down the broad stairway three steps
at a time. He was just near the bottom when he
passed a tall and rather sour-looking teacher, who
was coming up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Ruddy, not so fast&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the
teacher, when of a sudden Pepper Ditmore struck
the man on the shoulder, hurling him flat on his
back at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse me, Mr. Crabtree!&rdquo; burst out the
cadet. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to run into you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&mdash;you imp!&rdquo; spluttered Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;What do you mean by tearing downstairs like
a&mdash;a cyclone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re after a fellow who threw some mud up
into our room,&rdquo; explained Jack Ruddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you coming,&rdquo; added Pepper.
&ldquo;Very sorry&mdash;it shan&rsquo;t occur again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This jumping downstairs has got to be
stopped!&rdquo; fumed Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;I shall make
an example of you, Ditmore. Go back to your
classroom and write this sentence one hundred
times: &lsquo;It is best to walk with care.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I got to go back now?&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair, Mr. Crabtree. I didn&rsquo;t mean to
run into you; really, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! I want no back talk. To the classroom
instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; put in Jack Ruddy,
&ldquo;please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, Master Ruddy, or I shall send you,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch that boy if you can, Jack,&rdquo; said Pepper,
and walked slowly towards his classroom.
Josiah Crabtree saw him enter, and saw Jack
Ruddy leave the building, and then continued on
his way upstairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Jack Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore were chums.
Both hailed from the western part of New York
State, and they had arrived at Putnam Hall about
a month before this tale opens. Jack was a few
months older than Pepper, but the youths were
of the same size and weight. Jack was of a serious
turn and studious, while Pepper was rightly
called the Imp, on account of his fun-loving disposition.</p>
<p>At the time of which I write, Putnam Hall
was a new institution of learning. It was located
on Cayuga Lake, in New York State, not many
miles from the village of Cedarville. It was a
handsome structure of brick and stone, standing
in the middle of a parade ground of about ten
acres. In front was a well-kept wagon road, and
beyond this the grounds sloped down to the lake,
where were located the academy boathouse and
bathing houses. To the rear of the school were
the barns and a storehouse, and on one side a
well-fitted-up gymnasium, all backed up by a
stretch of thick woods.</p>
<p>On the ground floor of the Hall, which was
built in the shape of the letter E, were located
the classrooms and also a drillroom and a messroom,
all reached by three entrances, each of imposing
appearance. Above the ground floor
were the sleeping apartments, those for the students
divided into dormitories holding four, six,
or eight cadets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>The master of the school was Captain Victor
Putnam, a bachelor, and a West Point graduate.
The captain had seen strenuous service in
the West, where he had fought under the gallant
General Custer during several Indian uprisings.
But a fall from a horse had placed him on a sick
bed, and when he regained his health he decided
to give up army life, and go back to his former
profession of teaching. Money had been left to
him, and with this he purchased the grounds
and built the academy.</p>
<p>As was to be expected from a military man,
the school was organized upon military lines, and
each cadet was given instructions in military
duties daily. All were clothed in neat but serviceable
uniforms, and there was a general parade
each day, just before supper.</p>
<p>To get the school into proper shape, Captain
Putnam had hired three retired officers of the
army to drill the boys daily. Under their
tuition all of the scholars had learned rapidly,
and now the master of the Hall was about to let
the cadets choose their own officers and do their
own drilling, under his sole management.</p>
<p>Captain Putnam was a well-educated man, and
taught several classes in the school, besides looking
after the general management. His head
assistant was Josiah Crabtree, just introduced,
and his second assistant was George Strong,
whom we shall meet later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Josiah Crabtree was a morose individual, with
a very exalted opinion of himself. He had
come to the Hall with high recommendations,
but it cannot be said that Captain Putnam liked
the man, and as for the cadets, they nearly all
hated him.</p>
<p>Leaving the building, Jack Ruddy hurried to
the spot where his chum had seen the boy called
Mumps. He found the boy talking earnestly
to a big, burly youth, who carried a baseball bat
in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lots of fun,&rdquo; Mumps was saying, as
Jack strode up. &ldquo;I struck Andy Snow, and
Hen Lee, and some fellows in dormitory No. 4,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you struck me, you sneak!&rdquo; cried
Jack, catching the boy by the arm. &ldquo;I suppose
you thought it fine fun to cover me with
mud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! let me go!&rdquo; cried Mumps, in sudden
alarm. &ldquo;Let me go. I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You threw a lump of mud up into our room
and struck me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out of it. I&rsquo;ve a good mind
to box your ears, Mumps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you let that kid alone,&rdquo; came from the
big boy with the baseball bat. &ldquo;Leave him alone,
I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Dan Baxter, this is none of your
quarrel,&rdquo; retorted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let him alone when I feel like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let him alone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; Jack caught Mumps by the collar
and shook him thoroughly. &ldquo;Now, after this,
you behave yourself, or I&rsquo;ll thrash you good,&rdquo;
he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; screamed the boy. &ldquo;Le&mdash;let up!
Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t shake my head off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; roared Dan Baxter. &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;
And rushing in he took hold of Jack and tried
to draw him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter, let go of me,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly, but
with determination. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; came from the big youth with a
sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; retorted Jack, and turning from
Mumps, he gave a quick push that sent Dan Baxter
flat on the turf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERIOUS SLOOP</span></h2>
<p>The attack had come so unexpectedly that for
the moment Dan Baxter did not know what to
do. In a dazed fashion he sat up, and finally
scrambled to his feet. Mumps, the toady and
sneak, gazed at Jack Ruddy in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch it for that!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Dan
Baxter&rsquo;ll most kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has got to spell able first,&rdquo; murmured
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, what did you do that for?&rdquo; spluttered
Dan Baxter, when he could collect himself
sufficiently to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you this was none of your affair!&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;After this you attend to your
own business, and I&rsquo;ll attend to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you to let up on Mumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are not my master, Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumps is under my protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you mean is, that he is one of your
toadies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s toady,&rdquo; came from John
Fenwick, but his face grew as red as a beet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are, and you&rsquo;re a sneak in the bargain,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to give you a crack with
this,&rdquo; burst out Dan Baxter, as he swung his baseball
bat aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, don&rsquo;t you hit Jack Ruddy with that!&rdquo;
came a voice from the rear, and on the instant
another cadet caught hold of the bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Andy,&rdquo; came from Jack. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to take part in this too, eh?&rdquo;
said Dan Baxter, turning to the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only want to see fair play,&rdquo; answered
Andy Snow, a tall, slender boy, who was a good
deal of an acrobat, and at the head of the gymnasium
class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, were you up in your dormitory a while
ago?&rdquo; questioned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get hit with a lump of mud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;d like to spot the rascal that threw
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hit myself. That&rsquo;s why I came down
after Mumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the guilty party, eh?&rdquo; cried Andy
Snow, stepping up to John Fenwick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; screamed the lank boy, and turning,
he ran off at top speed. &ldquo;Come on, Dan!&rdquo; he
called out, when at a safe distance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have
anything more to do with &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time a crowd of a dozen was beginning
to collect. Dan Baxter gazed around uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll settle this some other time,&rdquo; he muttered,
and edged away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better settle it now,&rdquo; retorted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got something else to do,&rdquo; faltered
Dan Baxter, and then he turned and followed his
toady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter is afraid of you, Jack,&rdquo; came from
Andy Snow. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bully if ever there was
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is a bully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thrashing would do him good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll get it unless he minds what he is
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mean trick of Mumps to throw mud
in at the windows,&rdquo; went on Andy Snow, as they
walked away. &ldquo;I had just put on a clean shirt
when it hit me in the shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumps is as much of a mean sneak as Baxter
is a bully, Andy. They make a fine team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you bound?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper Ditmore and I were going for a row
on the lake, but Pep got into trouble with Mr.
Crabtree and had to go to the classroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for a row if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We haven&rsquo;t much time, but we can
take a short row anyway. It&rsquo;s a pity Pep isn&rsquo;t
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and he are great chums, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You see, it is this way: His father
and mine were old college chums, and we take
after them. Besides that, his father and mine
are associated in several business affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boathouse was soon gained, and the two
cadets brought forth a rowboat of fair size, and
two pairs of oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, you fellers!&rdquo; came from back of the
boathouse. &ldquo;Is it yerselves that&rsquo;s afther wantin&rsquo;
company, I don&rsquo;t know? If yez do, it&rsquo;s meself
will be afther comin&rsquo; along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Emerald!&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;Yes,
come on if you wish&mdash;there is room enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s meself that would loike to learn how
to row,&rdquo; said Joseph Hogan, as he stepped into
the craft. He was a pleasant-faced Irish lad,
who had come to Putnam Hall on the day the
institution opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Emerald, we&rsquo;ll give you lessons,&rdquo;
came from Andy Snow. &ldquo;Wait till we get out
on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>The craft was shoved off, and Jack and Andy
seated themselves at the oars. Soon they were
gliding over the surface of Cayuga Lake in fine
style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; it looks aisy enough,&rdquo; said Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy&mdash;after you know how,&rdquo; answered
Andy. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he went on to Jack, &ldquo;are
you going in for that boat race next week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and so is Pepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough. I hope you both win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they were well out on the lake both
boys stopped rowing, and allowed Joseph Hogan
to take a pair of the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, take hold this way,&rdquo; said Andy Snow,
&ldquo;and pull like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Irish lad tried. At first his blades slipped
quite frequently, and once he splashed some
water into the craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Emerald, we&rsquo;ve
had all the bath we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t mane to wet yez,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;The oars schlipped before I knew
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the Irish boy was doing better,
and they turned down the lake. As they did
this they noticed a small sailing boat approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that craft again!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What craft is that, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot, Andy. It&rsquo;s a sloop Pepper and
I saw day before yesterday. We thought the fellows
on board acted queerly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sailed up and down the shore at least
ten times, as if they were on the lookout for
something or somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was on board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men. I tried to catch a good look at
their faces, but they wouldn&rsquo;t give me a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly queer they should sail up and
down here,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Did they
come from Cedarville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the strange sloop was close at
hand. The same two men were in command,
but both kept their faces turned away as the rowboat
glided by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice how they kept their faces hidden?&rdquo;
queried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I did that,&rdquo; answered Hogan. &ldquo;B&rsquo;ys,
they are up to some thrick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is strange,&rdquo; said Andy, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;See, they are turning back once
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they know some of the cadets, and
would like to meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely they want to steal some of
our boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sloop turned again on her course, and it
was not long before both craft were only a short
distance apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hail them, and learn what they
have to say for themselves,&rdquo; whispered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sloop ahoy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first there was no reply to this shout. Jack
repeated the call, and Andy brought the rowboat
still closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; growled one of the
men on the sloop, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine day,&rdquo; said Jack, brightly.</p>
<p>To this there was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for anybody around here?&rdquo; came
from Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw you cruising around here day before
yesterday, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; continued Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you did. We&rsquo;ve been out on the lake
quite some the past week,&rdquo; answered the second
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought, if you were looking for somebody,
I might help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t help us,&rdquo; growled the one who
had first spoken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you belong at Putnam Hall?&rdquo; questioned
the other occupant of the sloop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we do that,&rdquo; answered Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got many pupils there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty or fifty so far,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! How many teachers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two regular teachers, besides Captain Putnam.
Then we have others for French, and German,
and music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the regular teachers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree and Mr. Strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they stay there all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must grow rather monotonous for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we try to make it lively enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they ever go to town, or go boating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Mr. Strong is quite an oarsman,&rdquo;
came from Andy, who had been out with
the second assistant on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>At this announcement both of the men exchanged
glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can come ashore and look at the school
if you wish,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, we don&rsquo;t care to do so,&rdquo; was
the hasty answer; and a moment later the sloop
veered off, and was soon out of speaking distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are a queer pair and no mistake,&rdquo;
murmured Jack. &ldquo;Did you notice how one kept
his hand over his forehead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how the other had his cap pulled far
down over his eyes,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an nayther of &rsquo;em looked roight sharp
to me,&rdquo; put in Hogan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not like to be
spendin&rsquo; much toime in their company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they are up to something,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll find out later,&rdquo; answered Andy.
And they did find out, in a manner that was as
thrilling as it was astonishing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">A CASE OF BRIBERY</span></h2>
<p>When the boys got back to the boathouse they
found Pepper Ditmore awaiting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dashed off that bit of writing as soon as I
could,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My, but wasn&rsquo;t it mean of
old Crabtree to make me do it! But wait, I&rsquo;ll get
square on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pep, we met that strange sloop again,&rdquo; said
Jack, and told of what had been said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mystery there, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;Perhaps we had better report
to Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on now. We&rsquo;ve got ten minutes
before parade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Putnam&rsquo;s office was a finely furnished
apartment, just off the main classroom. They
found the master of the school engaged in writing
a letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentlemen, what can I do for
you?&rdquo; he said cheerily as they entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got something to tell you, sir,&rdquo; they
answered, and then Jack quietly related their
story.</p>
<p>The master of Putnam Hall listened with close
attention, and questioned each one of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly odd,&rdquo; said he, meditatively.
&ldquo;Still, there may be nothing of importance in it.
If you see the sloop hovering around again, let
me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, sir,&rdquo; answered Jack, and then he
and his companions hurried off.</p>
<p>The drum was already rolling, and all of the
cadets lost no time in getting out on the parade
ground. It was a beautiful day in early October,
with just enough of coolness to make it
bracing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battalion will fall into line!&rdquo; was the
command, from one of the old army officers present,
and then the cadets of Company A and Company
B took the places assigned to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Company, attention!&rdquo; was the command
from the officer in charge of Company A, to
which Jack, Pepper, and Andy belonged. And
then followed a similar command to Company B.</p>
<p>While the battalion was at attention, Captain
Putnam came forth and mounted a small stand
that was handy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, gazing, at the
assembled cadets, &ldquo;I have an announcement of
importance to make to you. In the past you have
been under the command of Captain Wilson
and Lieutenants Plummer and Montgomery,
who have drilled you thoroughly in the arts and
duties of the soldier. These instructors will leave
the Hall early next week, and then I intend to
place the battalion in charge of such officers as
you may select for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; came the shout. &ldquo;Three cheers
for Captain Putnam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Captain Wilson and his assistants!&rdquo;
was the added cry, and the cheers
were given with a will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you well know, ever since this school
was organized I have been keeping a close watch
on every cadet, to find out who was fit to take
command. I have prepared a list of sixteen
names, which you will find hung up in the general
library and in the gymnasium. Of these
names the first eight are eligible for the rank of
major of the battalion, and all are eligible for the
rank of captain, or first or second lieutenant. The
position of sergeant or corporal may be filled by
any cadet in the school. Voting for the various
officers will take place to-morrow, directly after
the regular school session.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; came another shout, as the captain
stepped down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion, attention!&rdquo; came the command,
a moment later. &ldquo;Carry arms! Present arms!
Support arms! Shoulder arms! Forward,
march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tap! tap! tap-tap-tap!&rdquo; went the drums, and
off moved the young soldiers. They marched
around the parade ground twice, and then into
the mess-hall, where each cadet took his place at
one or another of the long dining tables. It was
a spirited scene, and one calculated to make the
heart of each boy bound with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is on that list, Jack,&rdquo; whispered
a cadet sitting near. &ldquo;I saw Peleg Snuggers
tacking it up in the gym as I came away.&rdquo; Peleg
Snuggers was the general utility man around
Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are on it, too, Joe,&rdquo; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; returned Joe Nelson, who was a quiet
and studious cadet, hailing from Philadelphia.
&ldquo;And Andy Snow and Henry Lee are on it,
too,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence at the table!&rdquo; broke in the rough
voice of Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;If I hear any more
of that, I&rsquo;ll send you away without your supper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured Joe Nelson. It was rarely
that he had any trouble with any of the teachers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, but old Crabtree is crusty enough to
make pie of,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s whispered comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, I say!&rdquo; thundered the first assistant.
&ldquo;I will have silence!&rdquo; And he looked
around the board so fiercely that hardly anybody
dared to say another word.</p>
<p>At the next table sat Dan Baxter and Mumps,
the sneak. The former scowled darkly at Jack
and Andy, while the sneak put his tongue into
his cheek at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fix Mumps,&rdquo; whispered Pepper,
who had been told of the occurrence in the school
yard, and watching his chance, he leaned back in
his chair and dropped a bit of sharp fish-bone
down inside the sneak&rsquo;s collar.</p>
<p>At first the sneak did not notice what had been
done, but then he made a side turn and of a sudden
uttered a yell of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! who&rsquo;s sticking me with a pin?&rdquo; he
roared. &ldquo;Drop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced around, but the boys on both sides
of him were busy with their eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Master Fenwick?&rdquo; questioned
George Strong, the second assistant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody stuck me with a&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;m stuck
again! Oh! oh! Something is down my back!&rdquo;
And the sneak began to wiggle from side to side.
&ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better leave the room and find out
what is the matter,&rdquo; said the teacher, and still
twisting and squirming, Mumps left the mess-hall
in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter, do you know anything of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange; what could be the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were a few minutes of silence, and
then the sneak came back and dropped into his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fish-bone&mdash;awfully sharp, too,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Somebody must have dropped it down
my back, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a titter, in which our friends joined.
Pepper winked at Jack, Andy, and Joe Nelson,
and they understood.</p>
<p>As soon as the meal was over, the cadets
rushed off to the library of Putnam Hall and to
the gymnasium, to scan the list of names the
master had mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bart Conners is at the head,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Harry Blossom comes next, Jack is third,
Henry Lee fourth, myself fifth, Dave Kearney
sixth, Stuffer Singleton next, and Dan Baxter
next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those are the ones who may be made
major,&rdquo; came from a cadet named Dale Blackmore,
one of the leading athletes of the academy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are up next, Dale,&rdquo; returned Jack.
&ldquo;That means you may become a captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be captain of the football team,&rdquo;
answered Dale, with a smile.</p>
<p>As soon as the list was scanned, an animated
discussion took place regarding the merits of the
different candidates. As among men, and especially
politicians, there was a good bit of &ldquo;log-rolling&rdquo;
and electioneering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Henry Lee ought to be major,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;He is one of our best soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is no better soldier than you are, Jack,&rdquo;
returned Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; came from Pepper. &ldquo;Jack
ought to be major, and Henry one of the captains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Baxter is working hard to become
major,&rdquo; came from a cadet who had just strolled
in. &ldquo;Somebody told me he was actually trying
to buy votes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy them? Do you mean with money?&rdquo;
queried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So somebody told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that can&rsquo;t be true, Jerry. Why, who in
this school would be mean enough to sell his
vote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Baxter has got a wad of rocks all right
enough. I saw the money myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to watch him,&rdquo; came from Pepper,
and he motioned for Andy Snow to go
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do, if you learn he is really
offering money for votes?&rdquo; questioned Andy, as
they hurried away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, Andy. But it would be a
mean piece of business. Why, in politics that is
bribery, and they can arrest a man for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that&mdash;but it&rsquo;s seldom a briber is
caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not difficult to trace Dan Baxter. From
a small cadet they learned he was down by the
lake, back of the row of bathing-houses.</p>
<p>By going down to the boathouse first, and then
stealing along a fringe of bushes skirting the lake
shore, they reached the bath-houses without being
seen. As it was past the bathing season, the
houses were supposed to be &ldquo;out of commission,&rdquo;
and locked up, but one of them&mdash;the largest&mdash;stood
wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is the chance of your life, if you
only know it,&rdquo; reached their ears, in the voice of
Dan Baxter. &ldquo;Besides, you know well enough
that I would make as good a major as anybody in
the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine way to blow one&rsquo;s own horn,&rdquo;
murmured Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what will you give me, Baxter, if I
work for you?&rdquo; came from a big boy named Gus
Coulter. He, too, was a bully, and, coming from
humble parentage, had very little spending
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you five dollars, Gus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give it to me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;ll promise to do all you can to
elect me major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, hand over the money,&rdquo; answered
Gus Coulter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon work for
you as anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I have a fiver, too?&rdquo; put in
Mumps, who was present. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work as hard as
Gus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two dollars, Mumps,&rdquo; said the
bully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do I come in on this?&rdquo; came from a
lad named Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two dollars, too, Nick, if you&rsquo;ll
vote for me and try to get others to do so, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Aren&rsquo;t my services worth as much
as Gus Coulter&rsquo;s?&rdquo; demanded Nick Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m elected I&rsquo;ll give you two dollars
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, hand over the dough, Dan. As
Gus says, I&rsquo;d just as soon work for you as for
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a barefaced thing to do!&rdquo; whispered
Andy Snow. &ldquo;Baxter can&rsquo;t have a bit of honor
about him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others are just as bad&mdash;to take his
money,&rdquo; whispered Pepper in return. &ldquo;If they&mdash;who&rsquo;s
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what are you doing here?&rdquo; demanded
a rough voice behind them, and a cadet named
Sabine appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; cried Dan Baxter, and
rushed from the bath-house. &ldquo;Humph! Pepper
Ditmore and Andy Snow! So you&rsquo;ve been spying
on us, eh? That&rsquo;s a nice business to be into,
I must say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">ELECTING A MAJOR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Have they been spying on us?&rdquo; queried
Mumps, and turned slightly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have been spying&mdash;I caught them
at it,&rdquo; came from Billy Sabine. &ldquo;What have you
fellows been up to here?&rdquo; he added, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind just now,&rdquo; answered Dan Baxter.
He looked much disconcerted. &ldquo;Just step
in here a minute, will you?&rdquo; he requested, of
Pepper and Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of us?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
cautiously, while Andy also held back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been listening to our talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mean piece of business, Pepper Ditmore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half as mean as what you were up to,
Dan Baxter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was I up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were bribing these fellows to vote for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t. I&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;we were talking
about something else. It&rsquo;s a&mdash;er&mdash;a secret
society,&rdquo; stammered the bully. He did not know
what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;You were bribing
them to vote for you for major,&mdash;paying
them from two to five dollars apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shut up!&rdquo; roared Baxter, rushing up
to Andy and catching him by the arm. &ldquo;I know
what I&rsquo;m doing. I don&rsquo;t want any talk from
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran Andy against the side of the bath-house,
but as said before, Andy was a good deal
of an acrobat, and in a twinkling he had slipped
from Baxter&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get out of here, Andy,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;We have seen and heard enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to blab on us?&rdquo; demanded
Gus Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends upon what you do,&rdquo; retorted
Pepper, bravely. &ldquo;We are not going to stand for
such underhanded work as has been going on
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dare to say a word I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll thrash
you within an inch of your life!&rdquo; hissed Dan
Baxter, rushing forward and catching Pepper by
the throat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to do it! Don&rsquo;t you
dare!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Le&mdash;let up, Baxter!&rdquo; gasped Pepper. He
pushed the bully back with his hand. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t, eh? Then take that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, he landed a blow that took Dan
Baxter full in the face and sent him staggering
back several paces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; came the cry from
the parade ground, and half a dozen cadets appeared,
including Joe Nelson and Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Baxter will tell you,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t anything to say!&rdquo; stammered
the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have something to say!&rdquo; cried Pepper,
boldly. &ldquo;Boys, take care that he doesn&rsquo;t try to
bribe you to vote for him. He has just bribed
Coulter, Paxton, and Mumps. I saw him pay
over his money, and so did Andy Snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a&mdash;falsehood!&rdquo; stormed Dan Baxter.
He was beside himself with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;It was
the most disgraceful thing I ever witnessed in my
life. We don&rsquo;t want such a chap for a major, or
even for a captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we don&rsquo;t want him even for a high
private,&rdquo; came from somebody in the crowd.</p>
<p>Gus Coulter whispered to Baxter, and then to
Paxton and to Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; whispered Mumps.
&ldquo;Our word is as good as theirs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What these fellows say is not true,&rdquo; came
from Gus Coulter. &ldquo;I was never bribed in my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t accept a bribe,&rdquo; put in Paxton,
loftily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that sort, and my friends
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all belong to a secret society, and we were
counting up the money in the treasury,&rdquo; said
Mumps. &ldquo;In the midst of it Ditmore and Snow
rushed up and intimated that Dan was bribing
us. They ought to have their heads punched
for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll never punch them, Mumps,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;And Baxter won&rsquo;t punch them,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure about that,&rdquo; growled Dan
Baxter. &ldquo;You may get more than you expect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of you,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>Further talk was cut short by the ringing of the
school bell, calling the cadets into the Hall. Baxter
and his cronies went off in one bunch, while
Pepper, Andy, and Jack went off in another.</p>
<p>Among so many cadets opinions were necessarily
divided. Some thought Baxter guilty,
while others believed in his protestations of innocence.
Yet with it all, the bully had only a limited
circle of friends and hangers-on, as later
events proved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>During the evening the air was filled with subdued
excitement. All of the candidates for the
officers&rsquo; positions were discussed, and it was generally
admitted that Jack, Bart Conners, Henry
Lee, and Dan Baxter stood equal chances of
winning the majorship, or at least one of the captaincies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you win the majorship, Jack,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;You are just suited for that position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it, Andy, I must confess. But I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;m not well enough known. Big Bart
Conners has a host of friends&mdash;and he is a staving
good chap in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the following morning it was easily to
be seen that Dan Baxter had been working hard
to win the cadets over to him. The bully and his
cronies had done a good deal of talking, and in
a few cases it looked as if he had been doing additional
bribing.</p>
<p>During the recess electioneering became warm
once more, and the students gathered in little
knots to discuss the situation. Jack, Pepper, and
several others were talking together when Dan
Baxter strolled up, with a dark look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I want this talk about bribery stopped,&rdquo;
he said, savagely. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand it&mdash;do you
understand? I won&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; And he shook
his fist at the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t stand it, sit down on it, Baxter,&rdquo;
retorted Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; roared the bully, for the benefit
of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Pepper tells the truth,&rdquo; came from
Jack, eying Baxter boldly. &ldquo;He caught you in
the act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;d say so, Jack Ruddy, you&rsquo;re
so anxious to be elected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to be elected,&rdquo; came
from Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither do I,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;I saw it
as well as Pepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s false! Absurd!&rdquo; roared Baxter, and
then, as there seemed nothing more to say, he
walked off with his head held high in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes me tired,&rdquo; came from Dale Blackmore.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never vote for him, even if he hadn&rsquo;t
started to bribe the fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voting began directly after dinner. There
was a large ballot box, and the cadets were given
slips of paper and pencils, so that they might
put down the names of their candidates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are seventy-seven students present,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam. &ldquo;Consequently it will take
thirty-nine votes for a choice. We will now take
the vote for the majorship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>There was a moment of silence, during which
the students put down the names of their candidates,
and then the line filed past the ballot-box,
and each youth deposited his ballot. Without
delay the captain and George Strong tabulated
the vote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will now read the result of the first ballot,&rdquo;
announced Captain Putnam, and at once the cadets
became silent.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Number of votes cast, 77;</p>
<p class="t0">Necessary to a choice, 39;</p>
<p class="t0">Bart Conners has 21,</p>
<p class="t0">John Ruddy has 21,</p>
<p class="t0">Henry Lee has 14,</p>
<p class="t0">Harry Blossom has 9,</p>
<p class="t0">Daniel Baxter has 7,</p>
<p class="t0">David Kearney has 3,</p>
<p class="t0">Andrew Snow has 1,</p>
<p class="t0">Paul Singleton has 1.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Bart and Jack are a tie!&rdquo; exclaimed
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got one vote,&rdquo; put in Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you must have voted for yourself,&rdquo; put
in Gus Coulter, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, I didn&rsquo;t have to bribe myself to do
it,&rdquo; retorted Andy. He raised his voice: &ldquo;Whoever
voted for me, will kindly vote for Jack
Ruddy on the next ballot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I also wish to withdraw in favor of Jack
Ruddy,&rdquo; came from Dave Kearney. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe I can fill the position of major just yet,&rdquo;
he added, by way of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please cross me off the list,&rdquo; sang out Paul
Singleton, a fat youth, who went by the
nickname of Stuffer because he was always
hungry.</p>
<p>After this came a little more electioneering,
and Henry Lee said he would withdraw and give
Jack his support if Jack&rsquo;s friends would vote for
him for captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll do that, Henry,&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>The second ballot was soon cast, and resulted
as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Number of votes cast, 77;</p>
<p class="t0">Necessary to a choice, 39;</p>
<p class="t0">For John Ruddy, 48;</p>
<p class="t0">For Bart Conners, 20;</p>
<p class="t0">For Harry Blossom, 5;</p>
<p class="t0">For Daniel Baxter, 4.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Jack is elected!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and
rushing forward he caught his chum by the
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you, Major Ruddy,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam, with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I move we make the election of Jack Ruddy
unanimous!&rdquo; called out Bart Conners. &ldquo;I voted
for him, and I want all of you to do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; sang out
a student. &ldquo;Bart, you&rsquo;re a good fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Major Ruddy, Captain Putnam,
and Bart Conners!&rdquo; came the cry, and the
cheers were given with a will. But Dan Baxter
and his cronies did not join in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sold me out!&rdquo; muttered the bully to
Mumps. &ldquo;Some of the fellows who said they&rsquo;d
vote for me didn&rsquo;t vote for me at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d square up with them for it,&rdquo; returned the
sneak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll square up with Jack Ruddy
too,&rdquo; added Dan Baxter, bitterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">OFF ON A PICNIC</span></h2>
<p>As soon as the excitement attending Jack&rsquo;s
election had subsided, Captain Putnam announced
that they would proceed next to the election
of two captains, one for Company A, and
one for Company B. For this purpose each student
was allowed to put down two names, making
the total number of votes cast one hundred and
fifty-four.</p>
<p>True to their promise, many who had supported
Jack voted in favor of Henry Lee, and as
a consequence he was made captain of the first
company. Bart Conners became captain of Company
B. Later still, Harry Blossom became first
lieutenant, and Dave Kearney a second lieutenant.
For all of these positions Dan Baxter received
not more than six votes, much to his disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a put-up job,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;But just
wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fix them!&rdquo; And then he and his cronies
said no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>After the voting was over, Captain Putnam
called the newly elected officers together and gave
them their instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall leave the battalion in your hands from
now on,&rdquo; he said to them. &ldquo;On parade and
during drill you must see to it that every cadet
does his duty. Of course, during school hours
and off hours, you will have no more authority
than any of your fellow pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want
any authority excepting on parade and during
drill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening the battalion celebrated on the
campus of the Hall, with a big bonfire and singing.
There was also a fancy drill and a short
parade, and all enjoyed it excepting Baxter and
his cronies. As soon as possible the latter sneaked
off in a little crowd by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied that Ruddy and his crowd
cooked this whole thing up against you, Dan,&rdquo;
said Coulter. &ldquo;Look at Lee. He sold out the
majorship just to get a captaincy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dave Kearney sold out so he could be
sure of becoming a lieutenant,&rdquo; put in Paxton.
&ldquo;It makes me sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some of the others sold me out,&rdquo;
growled the bully. &ldquo;I know twelve fellows who
said they&rsquo;d vote for me, and the most votes I got
were seven!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Ruddy must have bought them up,&rdquo; put
in Mumps. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a slippery one, he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The majority of the cadets, however, were well
satisfied over Jack&rsquo;s election, and they told the
newly elected major so. All shook him by the
hand, and wished him the best of success in his
position. He was called on to speak and made a
neat speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you all for electing me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
trust we shall all be friends, and that our relations
with one another will be pleasant from beginning
to end. I am going to try to do my duty,
and I know you will try to do yours. And because
you have made me major, don&rsquo;t forget that&mdash;during
school hours and off hours&mdash;I am one
of you anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; called out a cadet.
&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s the right kind of a major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Major Ruddy,&rdquo; was the
cry, and they were given loudly, and a tiger followed.</p>
<p>A number of the boys, including Pepper and
Andy, had worked hard to elect Jack and he felt
that he ought to do something for them in return.
He thought the matter over carefully and then
decided to ask a dozen of the cadets to go off on
a picnic with him on the following Saturday afternoon,
which would be a half-holiday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing, Jack,&rdquo; said Pepper, when the
thing was mentioned. &ldquo;We can have a jolly
time, in the woods and along the lake shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we take any grub along?&rdquo; came from
Stuffer Singleton, anxiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no picnic
without grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust Stuffer to remember about food!&rdquo;
laughed Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure we shall take something to eat
along,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrange it with the
captain and Mrs. Green, and I&rsquo;ll buy some extras
at Cedarville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the picnic, as it was called, was announced
those to take part became enthusiastic.
Not to make the other cadets feel bad, it was kept
a secret among those concerned. Captain Putnam
allowed the housekeeper to have two baskets
of provisions packed for Jack, and the young
major took Andy and Pepper with him to town,
where they purchased some extra dainties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be the dandiest of all picnics,&rdquo;
declared Pepper. &ldquo;A red-letter day for Putnam
Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to invite Dan Baxter?&rdquo; said
Andy, with a sly grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life, Andy!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was only joking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; put in Henry Lee. &ldquo;He
is as mad as hops because he wasn&rsquo;t elected an
officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any such bully as he is to be an
officer over me,&rdquo; came from Stuffer Singleton.</p>
<p>There were signs of rain in the air on Friday
and the students to participate in the picnic grew
anxious, fearing they would have bad weather.
But by the next morning the sun was shining as
brightly as ever, and soon all were ready for the
start, which was to be made at one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what do you think?&rdquo; cried Mumps,
coming up to where Baxter and Paxton were
standing. &ldquo;Jack Ruddy is going to take some of
the fellows out to the woods for a spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; queried the bully of Putnam
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overheard them talking about it in the gym.
They&rsquo;re going to take two or three baskets of
good things with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; cried Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to spoil their game,&rdquo; suggested
Gus Coulter. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do it, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Baxter became thoughtful.
&ldquo;Where are they going, Mumps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to Gerry&rsquo;s Point, on the lake. It&rsquo;s about
two miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might row up in one of the boats and see
what we can do,&rdquo; answered the bully. So it was
arranged, and Baxter, Paxton, and Mumps set
off without delay. Coulter wished to go along
but could not because he had an extra lesson to
do, he having missed several times during the
week.</p>
<p>Jack and his friends started in high glee. They
had three baskets filled with good things to eat
and to drink, and each basket was carried by two
boys, the handle having a stick passed through it
for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a swim,&rdquo; declared Andy.
&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a little late in the season, but the
water is pretty warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t mind
the cold water. Why, I take a cold bath two or
three times a week, in the bathtub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold baths are very healthy,&rdquo; came from another
of the crowd. &ldquo;My father used to be quite
weak, but now he takes a cold bath every morning
and it is wonderful how strong he is getting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path led back of the Hall grounds and then
through a dense woods fronting the lake, where
the shore made a sweeping turn. As the boys
were all good walkers, they covered the two miles
with ease, reaching Gerry&rsquo;s Point inside of an
hour after starting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then for a rest and a swim,&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll sample some of the good
things Jack has provided,&rdquo; added Stuffer, smacking
his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Stuffer, you could eat about all the time,
couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; queried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not all the time&mdash;he must sleep,&rdquo; put in
Jack, and this brought forth a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught myself eating once in my sleep,&rdquo;
said Stuffer. &ldquo;I began to cough and woke up
with a piece of pie in my hand. I had had the
nightmare, gone down to the kitchen pantry, and
helped myself. After that ma locked the pantry
up and hid the key.&rdquo; And at this tale there was
another laugh.</p>
<p>After a short rest the boys went in bathing,
placing their baskets in a secluded spot behind
some bushes. Not far away was a small
stream of water, and they did not know that in
this one of the Hall rowboats was hidden, containing
Baxter, Paxton, and Mumps, who had
watched their arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our chance!&rdquo; cried Baxter, when all
but two of the boys had gone in bathing. &ldquo;Let
us take their baskets and make off with them.
We can go up the lake shore and have a dandy
time on the good things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; put in Paxton. &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t
Jack Ruddy and the others be mad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, or they&rsquo;ll spot you!&rdquo; whispered
Mumps, in a trembling tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get scared, Mumps,&rdquo; said Baxter.
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t see us&mdash;the bushes are too thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the rowboat, the party of three stole
to the spot where the baskets were resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say but they are heavy,&rdquo; remarked Paxton
in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; came warningly from the bully, and
then nothing further was said. Each took a basket,
and started back for the rowboat as fast as
he could carry the load.</p>
<p>Baxter and Paxton had just placed their baskets
in the boat when there came a crash. Mumps,
who was bringing up the rear, had slipped and let
his basket fall, breaking a drinking glass and a
bottle of ginger ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; came from Jack,
who was standing in the water up to his waist.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s breaking glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered one of the cadets on shore.
&ldquo;It was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, there is Dan Baxter!&rdquo; yelled Pepper.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got one of our baskets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are running off with our things!&rdquo;
broke in Andy. &ldquo;Hi, stop, Baxter! Stop, Paxton!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go to grass!&rdquo; roared the bully of Putnam
Hall. He flung himself into the rowboat.
&ldquo;Quick, Paxton; quick, Mumps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paxton leaped in, basket in hand. But Mumps,
becoming frightened, let his load remain where it
had fallen and scrambled in headlong. Then the
oars were taken up and the craft shoved out into
the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop them! Stop them!&rdquo; came from Jack.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them get away, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/pfront.png" alt="&ldquo;STOP THEM! DON&rsquo;T LET THEM GET AWAY, BOYS!&rdquo;" width="500" height="790" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;STOP THEM! DON&rsquo;T LET THEM GET AWAY, BOYS!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swim for the boat,&rdquo; said another cadet.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter, stop your rowing!&rdquo; called a cadet on
shore. &ldquo;Stop, or I&rsquo;ll throw this!&rdquo; And he held
up a large and sharp stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t going to stop!&rdquo; muttered the bully.
&ldquo;Clear the track, you fellows!&rdquo; And he shook
his head at those in the water. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
get out of the way, I&rsquo;ll run over you!&rdquo; And
then he began to pull with might and main, while
Paxton did the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">AN ODD BIT OF PUNISHMENT</span></h2>
<p>For the moment the declaration by the bully
that he would run the boat into those in the water
kept the swimmers back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, fellows!&rdquo; cried Stuffer, in alarm.
&ldquo;That boat has got a pretty sharp bow. If it
hits you it will cut you deep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stop the boat anyway,&rdquo; cried
Jack, and continued to swim toward the craft.</p>
<p>As Jack did this, Andy measured his distance
and suddenly dove out of sight. Andy was as
good at swimming as he was at acrobatic feats,
and he did not come up until he was close to the
side of the rowboat. Then, before Baxter knew
what was up, he had hold of one of the oars and
jerked it out of the bully&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, give me back that oar!&rdquo; cried Baxter,
in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said Andy. And then, as Baxter
tried to hit him with the other oar, he dove
under the boat and gave it a sudden push that
nearly upset the craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; yelled Mumps, in alarm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!
We are going over! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time all of the crowd in the water were
surrounding the rowboat, and Jack lost no time in
pulling an oar from Paxton. Then he shoved the
end of the blade against Dan Baxter, and in a
twinkling the bully fell over against the gunwale.
Here Pepper caught him by the arm, and over
went Baxter into the water with a loud splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw me over!&rdquo; screamed Mumps.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t hardly swim a stroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you surrender?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Please don&rsquo;t throw me over!
I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t going to do anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton, do you surrender?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m going&mdash;&mdash;Hi! give me
that oar!&rdquo; For somebody had suddenly captured
the other blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t surrender we&rsquo;ll cast you adrift
without oars,&rdquo; came from Pepper, with a wink at
his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&mdash;you won&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; faltered Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we? You&rsquo;ll soon see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, cast him adrift,&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him away out into the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I&mdash;I surrender!&rdquo; said Paxton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>By this time Dan Baxter was walking ashore.
His clothes&mdash;a new suit, elegantly pressed,&mdash;were,
of course, soaked completely, and there was a
streak of mud over one shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make somebody pay for this!&rdquo; he
growled. &ldquo;It will cost two dollars to have this
suit fixed up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought it on yourself, Baxter,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. What right had you to try to
run away with our baskets of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t going to run off with &rsquo;em. I
was just fooling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; broke in Pepper.</p>
<p>Several surrounded the bully, so that he might
not run away, and the rowboat with Paxton and
Mumps was turned back to the point from where
it had started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us make them prisoners,&rdquo; suggested
Andy. &ldquo;They ought to be taught a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; came the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; faltered Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sit on it!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and tripped
the fellow up. While he and Stuffer made Paxton
a prisoner, the others attended to Dan Baxter
and Mumps. The prisoners had their hands
tied behind them, and each had a foot tied to the
root of a big tree, the boys using sections of boat
rope for that purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now let us finish our swim,&rdquo; said Jack, and
drew his crowd to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with them?&rdquo; whispered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to duck Paxton and Mumps,&rdquo; came
the suggestion. &ldquo;Baxter don&rsquo;t need any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us keep them bound up,&rdquo; said another.
&ldquo;They can look on while we are feasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;It will make
their mouths water to look at us getting outside
of the good things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let us pretend that we&rsquo;re going to leave
them tied up when we go away,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>So it was arranged, and, this settled, the boys
continued their swim and then dressed at their
leisure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, ain&rsquo;t you going to let us go?&rdquo; asked
Dan Baxter, after a long spell of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
decided to let you stay here until Sunday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday night!&rdquo; cried Mumps, in alarm. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to stay here all night and all day tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get afraid, Mumpsy dear,&rdquo; came from
Pepper. &ldquo;There are not very many bears around
these parts now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! one bear is enough!&rdquo; And the sneak
shivered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stay here until Sunday
night,&rdquo; came from Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, let us off, and maybe I&rsquo;ll call it
square,&rdquo; said Baxter, in a more reasonable
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t intend to call it square, Baxter,&rdquo;
answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t let us go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted the rest of the crowd.</p>
<p>After that the baskets were brought up and all
the good things spread out where Baxter, Paxton,
and Mumps could see them. Soon the cadets
were eating and drinking to their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter, wouldn&rsquo;t you like a drink of soda?&rdquo;
asked Pepper, coming up with a glass full of the
beverage. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be too hard on a fellow
student.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like a drink,&rdquo; grumbled the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, you shall have one&mdash;as soon as
you go down to Cedarville and put up the necessary
nickel at the store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to thunder!&rdquo; growled the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I have a drink?&rdquo; asked Mumps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
as dry as a&mdash;a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you can have a drink&mdash;but not of soda,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some water for all hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>He disappeared behind the bushes in the direction
of a spring. Soon he came back with three
glasses filled with water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a drink for each,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
going to be too mean about this. I know what it
is to go dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed a glass to Pepper and one to Stuffer,
and each of the cadets held his glass up to the
mouth of a prisoner. As Baxter, Paxton, and
Mumps were all dry, each drank eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; spluttered Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; came from Baxter, spitting out the
water. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s full of salt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will make us drier than ever!&rdquo; groaned
Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I took several swallows,&rdquo; growled Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; added Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure it&rsquo;s full of salt,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I
thought you all needed it, you&rsquo;re so fresh, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be gorry, that&rsquo;s the bist joke yit,&rdquo; came from
Emerald Hogan, with a roar. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s roight,
Andy, me b&rsquo;y, salt &rsquo;em down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll salt you down, Irish!&rdquo; cried Baxter, in
a rage. &ldquo;Just wait till I get back to the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>After this the bully and his cronies asked for
nothing more to eat or drink, but they wistfully
eyed the good things as the others disposed of
them. The salt made them fearfully dry, and
each would have given a good round sum for a
glass of pure, cold water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we can all get into that boat,&rdquo; said
Jack, after the feast had come to an end. &ldquo;A
row on the lake and back to the Hall would just
suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will give us a little practice for those races,&rdquo;
put in Pepper. &ldquo;I reckon we can manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to steal our boat?&rdquo; demanded
Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not your boat&mdash;it belongs to the
academy,&rdquo; retorted Jack. &ldquo;We have as much
right to it as you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we had it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need any boat just yet,&rdquo; said Stuffer.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to stay here, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! don&rsquo;t leave us here,&rdquo; cried Paxton.
&ldquo;Let us go and&mdash;er&mdash;I, for one, will call the
whole matter off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you really!&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Awfully
kind, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t let us go I&rsquo;ll tell on you,&rdquo; said
Mumps. &ldquo;The captain won&rsquo;t stand for anything
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got to say, Baxter?&rdquo; demanded
Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better let us go,&rdquo; grumbled the bully.
He did not fancy spending a night in the dark
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we let you go, will you keep your mouth
shut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said that I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll leave you tied up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; came from Mumps, pleadingly.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do it! Dan, tell them that you
won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t dare to leave us,&rdquo; said the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Wait and see.
Come on, fellows, put the baskets in the boat and
come on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to leave us,&rdquo; groaned Mumps,
as the baskets were stowed away and several
entered the craft. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to stay here all
night, and I know it is going to rain! And there
may be bears around! Peleg Snuggers told me
about a bear he saw once, on the road to Malville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be a calf, Mumps,&rdquo; interrupted the
bully. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all laugh at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I don&rsquo;t want to stay, so there!&rdquo;
whimpered the sneak. &ldquo;Tell them you won&rsquo;t say
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye!&rdquo; shouted Jack, turning toward
the rowboat.</p>
<p>He walked several steps, but then Baxter hailed
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the bully. &ldquo;Let us go. For
Mumps&rsquo; sake I won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Remember, Baxter, that&rsquo;s a bargain.
Are you agreed, Paxton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Mumps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;I promise, Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word Jack released the three
prisoners. Then he ran for the rowboat, leaped
in and shoved off, and soon the craft was on its
way out into the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">HOW THE BOAT RACES WERE WON</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll keep silent?&rdquo; asked
Stuffer, after the rowboat was some distance from
the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a problem,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Maybe
they will&mdash;for their own benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they talk about it, the laugh will be on
them,&rdquo; came from Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a fine dive of yours, Andy,&rdquo; came
from Pepper. &ldquo;You took them by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have been in a mess if they had
gotten away with the baskets and our clothes,&rdquo;
said Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an do yez think they&rsquo;d stale our duds?&rdquo;
questioned Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d take everything&mdash;if they got the
chance,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;It was lucky for us
that Mumps fell and gave the alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a calf he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneaks are generally of that sort,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;How I&rsquo;d hate to have the reputation he is
gaining.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>They looked back and saw Baxter, Paxton, and
Mumps standing on the shore. The bully shook
his fist at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He feels real friendly,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I think
he&rsquo;d like to embrace us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the rowboat passed out of sight of that
portion of the shore. Then the craft was turned
up the lake, and those who were to go into the
boat races during the following week took turns at
the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper pulls a fine stroke,&rdquo; said Stuffer.
&ldquo;He ought to win something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Jackson and Perry will win the main
races,&rdquo; said another cadet. &ldquo;They are bang-up
oarsmen. They live on the Ohio River and have
had lots of practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am going to do my best,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<p>The sun was just going down when the boys returned
to Putnam Hall, tired out but thoroughly
happy. They cleaned out the boat and put it
away, and then went to their dormitories to wash
up for parade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, look here!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he got out
his uniform. &ldquo;Somebody has been putting on
my rank of office.&rdquo; And this was true, and the
uniforms of the other elected officers had been
treated likewise. When the young officers went
below each received a shining sword, with a scabbard
and belt to match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to have our pictures taken,&rdquo; said
Henry Lee, with pride, and later on, this was
done, and each officer sent one or more of the
photographs home, much to the parents&rsquo; delight.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Jack felt quite proud
when he stepped out in front of the battalion,
sword in hand, and in his newly decorated uniform.
He saw his friends in the ranks and also
saw his enemies. Baxter looked as dark as a
thundercloud, but did not dare to express his
feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very well accomplished, Major
Ruddy,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam after the drill was
at an end. &ldquo;I trust you keep the battalion up to
such a standard for the balance of the term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do my best, sir,&rdquo; answered the youthful
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy seems to take hold with vigor,&rdquo; was
George Strong&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I like to see a boy
do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father was once in the army, and he has
military blood in his veins,&rdquo; answered the master
of the Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>The boat races which have been mentioned were
to come off on the following Wednesday afternoon,
starting at two o&rsquo;clock. There were to be
four races, three among the students of Putnam
Hall and the fourth race with the students of Pornell
Academy, situated a few miles from Putnam
Hall. Pornell Academy was an old institution
of learning presided over by a Dr. Pornell, who
did not much fancy the coming of Captain Putnam
to that neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we wax those Pornell fellows good,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;They are a proud lot, and they
think we are nothing but the dust of the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The races between ourselves will show what
we can do,&rdquo; answered Singleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to row, Stuffer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you win something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was a cool, bracing one, an ideal day
for boat racing, and immediately after the midday
meal the oarsmen turned out in force and the
lake front was alive with craft of various sorts.
The races had been talked of for two weeks and
several sloops and a steam launch came up from
Cedarville bringing parties to view the contests.
Some boats also came from across the lake, and
flags flapped gayly in the moderate breeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>The first race was a four-oared affair between
the smaller boys, and much to the surprise of
everybody it was won by Mumps and a lad named
Cathby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, I didn&rsquo;t know Mumps could row so
well,&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He comes from a town on the Hudson River,
and was brought up around boats,&rdquo; answered a
cadet standing near. &ldquo;His folks own several
sailboats, so I&rsquo;ve been told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he deserves credit for winning, even if
he is a sneak,&rdquo; declared Jack.</p>
<p>The next race was an eight-oared affair, between
crews made of Stuffer, Hogan, Blackmore,
and a number of others already mentioned in these
pages. This was lost by the crew led by Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuffer had been eating too much,&rdquo; said Pepper.
And the always-hungry lad afterwards admitted
that this was true.</p>
<p>The third race was a four-oared affair between
Jack, Pepper, Andy, and Joe Nelson on one side,
and Paxton and several chums on the other.
Baxter had been expected to row in this, but fell
out at the last moment, stating he was not
well. Privately, he was afraid of losing, for he
knew Jack and his friends were good oarsmen.</p>
<p>The race was for a mile, and at the discharge of
a pistol both crews started in fine shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Paxton!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;You can win
if you try!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, Pepper, pull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make every stroke tell, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on swept the two boats, and for the first
half of the course kept side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a tie race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, Paxton! Pull, Leeds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Paxton&rsquo;s boat is going ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true&mdash;slowly but surely the craft went
forward, until it was a full length in advance.
Jack, Pepper, and the others were doing their best
but the other boat continued to keep in the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a rope trailing behind!&rdquo; cried Pepper
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it goes,&rdquo; added Andy. &ldquo;It was caught
on the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All together, and give her tar!&rdquo; shouted Jack,
shutting his teeth hard. &ldquo;Pull, boys, pull!&rdquo;
And they did pull as never before.</p>
<p>But quarter of a mile of the race remained, and
now Jack&rsquo;s boat was crawling up to the rival
craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Paxton&rsquo;s boat is but half a length
ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are tie again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, everybody, and may the best crew win!&rdquo;
came from a gentleman in one of the sailboats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pa, I hope that last boat wins,&rdquo; cried a
girl in the sailing craft, a fine small yacht.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Laura,&rdquo; came from a second girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Flossie?&rdquo; questioned her father, with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. They look nicer than the
boys in the first boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? You have sharp eyes, I must say.&rdquo;
And then Mr. Ford, for such was the gentleman&rsquo;s
name, turned to the race once more.</p>
<p>Jack, Pepper, Andy, and Joe Nelson were working
like steam engines, and the same may be said
of their opponents. On and on swept the two
rowboats toward the finish line. There was a
wild yelling along the lake front and from the
various boats gathered around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we must win!&rdquo; shouted Joe Nelson,
and seemed to suddenly wake up. Jack and the
others also renewed their exertions, and now their
spurt carried them a foot in the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s boat is ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton is crawling up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true, the rivals were also spurting, and
for a moment the two craft were side by side once
more. But Paxton&rsquo;s crew could not keep up the
terrific pace, and suddenly they fell back, and
Jack and his friends shot over the line winners
by a full length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s crew wins!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a stiff race though, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he saw that he had lost Paxton fell
down in his boat and put his hand to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Paxton?&rdquo; asked George
Strong, who was in a boat nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a&mdash;a pain in&mdash;my&mdash;side,&rdquo; gasped Paxton.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old trouble, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I could have won if&mdash;it&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;for&mdash;that,&rdquo;
went on Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; returned the assistant teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and his crew were beat clean and clear,&rdquo;
whispered one of the cadets nearby, and this opinion
was the opinion of the majority who witnessed
the race.</p>
<p>When Jack and his crew landed at the boathouse
a crowd surrounded them, slapping them on
the backs and shaking hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was well won!&rdquo; cried Bart Conners.
&ldquo;But, say, wasn&rsquo;t there something the matter
with your boat at first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there was,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Somehow,
a rope caught fast to the bottom. If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for that I think we should have won
with ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know how that rope got there,&rdquo;
said Andy. But the mystery was never explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Half an hour later the race came off between
the Putnam Hall cadets and the crew from Pornell
Academy. None of our friends took part in
this affair, and to witness it to advantage Jack,
Pepper, and Andy went out in a small rowboat
and stationed themselves near the course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is that yacht that passed us while we
were racing,&rdquo; observed Andy, pointing the craft
out. &ldquo;See the girls who waved their handkerchiefs
at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look to be nice girls,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let
us get a little closer to the yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Jack must be smitten!&rdquo; came from
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; murmured Jack, turning red.
&ldquo;I only wanted to see who the gentleman was
who is on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;His name
is Ford, and he has a fine estate further up the
lake. Somebody told me he was rich. Those
girls must be his daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he knows much about handling
a yacht,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;See how he
is bringing her around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those girls want to be careful,&rdquo; came from
Andy. &ldquo;That boom may&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Andy got no further, for just then the yacht
swung around on another tack. Around came the
boom of the mainsail, hitting each of the girls on
the shoulder. Just then the yacht gave a lurch,
and with a wild scream of terror, the two maidens
slipped over the craft&rsquo;s side and disappeared beneath
the waters of Cayuga Lake!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE CADETS TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;They are overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be drowned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must save them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the three exclamations that came
from Jack, Pepper, and Andy as Laura and Flossie
Ford sank beneath the surface of the broad
and rippling lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughters! My daughters!&rdquo; came in an
agonizing cry from Rossmore Ford. &ldquo;Save
them! Save them! I cannot swim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save them!&rdquo; shouted back Jack, and
bent to the oars of the rowboat, while Pepper did
the same. Andy was in the bow, and stood up,
ready to dive overboard should it become necessary
to do so.</p>
<p>The mishaps had occurred some distance away
and it took nearly a minute for the small craft to
reach the locality. In the meantime both Laura
and Flossie had reappeared and were shrieking
for help. Both could swim a little, but not enough
to keep up with all of their clothing and their
shoes on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Save them! Save them!&rdquo; Mr. Ford continued
to call out, and tried his best to bring the
yacht around again.</p>
<p>By the time the rowboat was at hand the girls
had disappeared once more. As quick as a flash
Andy dove overboard, for he had caught a brief
glimpse of Flossie&rsquo;s dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the other one, Pep!&rdquo; called out Jack.
&ldquo;Keep the boat handy!&rdquo; And then he followed
Andy into the water.</p>
<p>It was a long dive for Jack, but it brought him
close beside Laura, and soon he had hold of the
girl and was bringing her to the surface. She
clutched him tightly, and he had all he could do to
keep her from shutting off his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t hold so tight&mdash;you&mdash;you are
safe,&rdquo; he gasped, when they got their heads above
water. &ldquo;Here is a rowboat. I&rsquo;ll put you in
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Laura. &ldquo;Ple&mdash;please don&rsquo;t
let me go down again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. Here&rsquo;s the boat. Now easy, Pep,
or you&rsquo;ll tip over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got her, Jack,&rdquo; was the reply, and bracing
himself in the rowboat, Pepper hauled the
young lady aboard.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic2.png" alt="&ldquo;I&rsquo;VE GOT HER, JACK!&rdquo;" width="500" height="788" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;I&rsquo;VE GOT HER, JACK!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Andy?&rdquo; questioned the young major,
looking around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; answered Pepper, and a moment
later Andy came up, holding Flossie by the back
of her shirt-waist. The girl was partly unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got tangled up in some wild grass on the bottom,&rdquo;
spluttered Andy. &ldquo;Here, take her,&rdquo; and he
held her up, and soon Flossie was resting on the
seats of the rowboat.</p>
<p>By this time several boats were coming up, including
the steam tug containing the judge of the
coming race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; was the cry. And this was
re-echoed on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they&mdash;they all right?&rdquo; asked Rossmore
Ford, in a faltering voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; murmured the rich
man. &ldquo;Will you bring the rowboat up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better lower your mainsail first,&rdquo; suggested
Pepper. This was done, and soon the rowboat was
alongside of the yacht, and then the girls were
passed up to the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, what has happened?&rdquo; murmured
Flossie, opening her eyes. She gave a shudder.
&ldquo;I&mdash;we went overboard, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; And she
gazed around in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Laura?&rdquo; questioned the
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, pa&mdash;but I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to fall overboard
again,&rdquo; said the older of the two sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; put in Flossie. She was recovering
rapidly. &ldquo;It was the boom struck us,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get out of the crowd,&rdquo; whispered Jack.
&ldquo;The girls are all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; answered Andy. And they
rowed away as rapidly as they had come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi!&rdquo; called out Rossmore Ford. &ldquo;Wait!
I want to thank you for what you have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, sir,&rdquo; called back Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; pleaded the rich
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go back,&rdquo; said Andy, and once
more the rowboat was turned around, and presently
they boarded the yacht and tied the small
craft behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those young ladies safe?&rdquo; asked the
judge of the race, from the steam tug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; answered Rossmore Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; and the tug soon after that moved
away, and so did the majority of the other boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you young gentlemen a good deal for
saving my daughters,&rdquo; said Rossmore Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget what you did,&rdquo; put in
Laura, with a bright glance at Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You saved us from death,&rdquo; came from Flossie,
and gave Andy a grateful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boom came around pretty lively,&rdquo; said
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The&mdash;er&mdash;fact is, I don&rsquo;t know as much
about sailing a boat as I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; answered the
owner of the yacht. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be more careful
in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked the cadets their names, and then introduced
himself and his daughters, and all shook
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa, we&rsquo;ll have to go home and put on some
dry clothing,&rdquo; said Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me, I never thought of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
the fond parent. &ldquo;To be sure&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go
back at once. Do you wish to go along, young
gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we had better stay behind and see the
race,&rdquo; answered Jack, after a questioning look at
his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I presume you are greatly interested. I
was interested myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your school wins,&rdquo; came from Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must give us a call some time,&rdquo; went on
Rossmore Ford. &ldquo;Our home is up the lake&mdash;Point
View Lodge we call it. We shall be glad to
see you any time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, perhaps we&rsquo;ll come up,&rdquo; said
Andy, and the others said practically the same.
Then the cadets jumped into their rowboat once
more and the yacht went on its way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are certainly nice people,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;You two fellows are regular heroes
for saving the maidens fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! As if you didn&rsquo;t have as much to do
with it as anybody!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t leap into the briny deep, as the novelists
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Briny deep is good,&rdquo; laughed Andy. &ldquo;Why,
the water isn&rsquo;t over twelve feet deep around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s deep enough to drown in. If you don&rsquo;t
believe it, stand on the bottom and find out.&rdquo; And
then there was a general laugh.</p>
<p>The race between the cadets of Putnam Hall
and the boys from Pornell Academy was now
about to start. Crack! went the pistol and down
into the clear waters of Cayuga Lake went the
oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Putnam Hall leads!&rdquo; came the cry half
a minute later.</p>
<p>It was true, almost from the start Putnam Hall
led by half a length. The oarsmanship of the
crew was perfect, and the lead was held for the
first half of the race.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if only they can keep it up!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, boys, go it!&rdquo; yelled Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
to win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show &rsquo;em what Putnam Hall can do!&rdquo; cried
Andy.</p>
<p>On and on flew the two boats. Putnam Hall
was still ahead, but only a few inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to lose the lead!&rdquo; cried Harry
Blossom. &ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we?&rdquo; came from Dave Kearney. &ldquo;Not
much! How is that for a spurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the captain of the Putnam Hall
crew spoke to his fellows, and in a twinkling the
time of the stroke was increased. Straight to the
front leaped the boat, until the stern was even
with the bow of the rival&rsquo;s craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Putnam Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, Pornell, pull! You&rsquo;ve got to win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the cries ran on and the crew of the Pornell
boat did their best to increase their stroke. But
they could not overtake Putnam Hall and when
the line was crossed the latter was the winner by
two lengths and a half.</p>
<p>A wild din went up. Horns tooted, rattles
clacked loudly, and cheer after cheer rent the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to beat &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pornell wasn&rsquo;t in it from start to finish!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better go home and learn to row!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rivals felt sheepish enough, and without
loss of time they rowed ashore and the members of
the crew disappeared, followed by those who had
come from Pornell Academy to see them win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have certainly done very well,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam, to the winning crew. &ldquo;Your stroke
was almost perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was well kept up,&rdquo; came from George
Strong. &ldquo;I never saw a prettier race in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josiah Crabtree had nothing to say, for he took
no interest in sports. But nobody paid attention
to the crabbed teacher.</p>
<p>The races were followed by a general holiday
time, in which nearly all of the cadets participated.
Only Dan Baxter and his crowd went away. They
departed for a deserted boathouse, and there sat
talking and smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose those fellows will have swelled heads
after this,&rdquo; muttered the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; grumbled Paxton. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care.
If they try to crow over me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; asked Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; came from the bully of the
school. &ldquo;We have got to take them down a peg
or two, or else they&rsquo;ll be running the whole Hall
to suit themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE CHUMS MAKE A CALL</span></h2>
<p>For a week after the races, matters at Putnam
Hall ran along smoothly. Captain Putnam insisted
upon it that the students attend to their
studies and our friends pitched in with vigor, so
that Jack stood first in his class, Pepper third, and
Andy fourth, which was certainly fine.</p>
<p>During that time Dan Baxter had a sharp &ldquo;run-in&rdquo;
with the master of the Hall, who gave the
bully a stern lecture. As a consequence Baxter
was quite humble for the time being and did not
risk doing anything to bring him into further
disgrace.</p>
<p>On a Tuesday morning Captain Putnam called
Jack, Pepper, and Andy into his private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, I hope we aren&rsquo;t in for a lecture!&rdquo;
whispered Andy while on the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been doing anything wrong?&rdquo;
asked Pepper with a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. I had some flour yesterday and
when I was upstairs old Crabtree was in the
lower hallway. Somehow the flour slipped out
of my hand and went down on Crabtree&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slipped is good!&rdquo; chuckled Jack. &ldquo;Did he
spot you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! I had business elsewhere, and I
dusted,&rdquo; answered his chum.</p>
<p>When they entered the office they found Captain
Putnam awaiting them with a smile and knew at
once that everything was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve received an invitation for you three lads,&rdquo;
said the master of the Hall. &ldquo;It is from Mr.
Rossmore Ford. He and his wife and daughters
are going to have a small gathering at their home
this afternoon and evening, and they would like
you to be present. If you desire to go you may do
so. Mr. Ford is anxious to do something to show
how much he appreciates what you did for his
daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Andy, who
was somewhat bashful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go by all means!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure we&rsquo;ll have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind going,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;They
seemed to be real nice people, and it would look
strange to refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>So it was settled that they should go, and Captain
Putnam said they could take a horse and
buggy from the Hall and make the journey to
Point View Lodge and back in that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remember to be back by eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
said the master of the Hall.</p>
<p>They were to start at two o&rsquo;clock, and immediately
after dinner they rushed up to their dormitory
to get ready. It was a rule of the establishment
that cadets must wear their uniforms
when going out on such occasions and they
brushed up as never before, and put on their best
collars, cuffs, and shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack is sprucing up for the girls,&rdquo; observed
Pepper, with a wink at Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sprucing up for the credit of the Hall,&rdquo;
retorted the young major. &ldquo;And you must do
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they went down to the barn, Peleg Snuggers
had the horse and buggy ready for them,
and the utility man told them of the road to take
to get to Point View Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ford is a swell gent,&rdquo; said Peleg Snuggers.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no more swell gent in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any danger of his bursting?&rdquo; queried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a land swell or a sea swell?&rdquo; questioned
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young gents know wot I mean,&rdquo; answered
the utility man. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rich&mdash;got millions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; murmured Jack. &ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;ll have
to put on swell airs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peleg, won&rsquo;t you lend me a diamond for my
shirt front?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t got no diamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll lend us a gold watch,&rdquo; suggested
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you stop a-jokin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; cried the utility
man. &ldquo;How am I to git diamonds an&rsquo; gold
watches on twenty dollars a month, answer me
that now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know you&rsquo;re rich, Peleg,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Some day you&rsquo;ll buy out the Hall and give us
free board, eh?&rdquo; And then the boys drove off,
leaving Peleg Snuggers standing grinning after
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys is boys, an&rsquo; allers will be!&rdquo; murmured
the man of all work. &ldquo;Bless &rsquo;em all,
say I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road to Point View Lodge was somewhat
rough and they had to drive along with care. In
some spots the trees overhung the road completely,
making the way rather dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be no mean drive getting back,&rdquo; said
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lantern, and we can drive slow,&rdquo;
answered Jack. &ldquo;We ought to start for the Hall
by half-past nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>At last they reached the Lodge, located on a
point of the lake shore. There were elegant
grounds, filled with shrubs and flowers, and a fine
mansion with broad piazzas. Off to one side was
a large summerhouse and to the other a barn and
sheds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is fine and no mistake,&rdquo; murmured Jack.
&ldquo;See, there is quite a crowd here, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stable-hand took care of their turnout, and
soon Rossmore Ford and his stately wife came
to greet them. Then the girls came also, and there
were warm handshakings all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very, very thankful for what you did for
Laura and Flossie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;I want
you to make yourselves at home here, and I trust
you have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid place,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>They were introduced to a number of the guests,
including several young men from Pornell Academy,
and then Laura and Flossie took them
around the mansion and grounds, showing them
various points of interest. The girls were bright
and lively and soon succeeded in making them feel
perfectly at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have several students from Pornell
here,&rdquo; said Jack to Laura, when they had drifted
a short distance away from the others.</p>
<p>At this Laura frowned slightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We did not expect them. They came
to make a call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them, Roy Bock, knows some of my
mother&rsquo;s people, and he comes on that account and
brings those others with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be making himself at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he acts as if he owned the place. Flossie
and I do not like them to come, but mamma
doesn&rsquo;t like to say anything, and pa is away most
of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took a ramble through the garden and
into a conservatory, and Laura gave Jack a big
rose for his buttonhole, while Flossie got roses for
Andy and Pepper. These had just been pinned on
when Roy Bock appeared, followed by three of
his fellow students from Pornell Academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here you are!&rdquo; cried Roy Bock, loudly.
&ldquo;We were wondering what had become of you.
Spooning, I suppose?&rdquo; he added, coarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were showing our friends around the
grounds,&rdquo; said Laura, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just heard you were the chaps that pulled
the girls out of the lake,&rdquo; said a student named
Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, anybody could have done that,&rdquo; came
from another, named Gussic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose anybody could have rowed that race,
too,&rdquo; said Jack, sharply. The manner of the rival
academy boys was very obnoxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I heard how your school won that race!&rdquo;
cried Flossie, her eyes beaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess our school didn&rsquo;t have a fair show,&rdquo;
growled Roy Bock. &ldquo;The Putnam Hall crew
started before the pistol went off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true!&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper. &ldquo;The
start was a very fair one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Of course you&rsquo;d say so,&rdquo; grumbled
the student named Gussic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say so because it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon all you fellows have the swelled head
now,&rdquo; put in Grimes. &ldquo;But just wait till the football
match comes off&mdash;we&rsquo;ll show you a trick or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t quarrel here!&rdquo; whispered
Laura, in a frightened tone. &ldquo;If you get Roy
Bock mad, he&rsquo;ll say all sorts of mean things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go back now,&rdquo; said Bock.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call again some day&mdash;when these fellows
ain&rsquo;t around. We don&rsquo;t want anything to do with
chaps who cheat at boat races.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bock, some day I&rsquo;ll make you take back those
words,&rdquo; said Jack, hotly. &ldquo;But we are guests
here, so I&rsquo;ll say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! I&rsquo;m not afraid of you,&rdquo; growled Roy
Bock, and then he strode off, followed by his fellow
students. Soon they left the house, on the
buckboard that had brought them to the Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how thankful I am that they are gone,&rdquo;
said Flossie. &ldquo;Do you know, I am getting afraid
of Roy Bock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a&mdash;a&mdash;puppy,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Excuse the
word, but I can&rsquo;t describe him in any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is very mean,&rdquo; came from Laura.
&ldquo;I wish he would keep away for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His companions are about as bad as he is,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;They seem to be all tarred with
the same brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are always together,&rdquo; said Flossie.
&ldquo;They always come here in a bunch and stay and
stay. It&rsquo;s a wonder they didn&rsquo;t invite themselves
to dinner. And then, so I&rsquo;ve been told, they tell
their fellow students that we urge them to come,
and that they can&rsquo;t hardly get away from here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were one or two other young folks present,
and all had a good time until dinner was
served. The repast was an elaborate one, and our
friends did it full justice. Then came some music
and a few games, and all too soon it was time for
Jack, Pepper, and Andy to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a boss time!&rdquo; cried Pepper, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Excuse the French!&rdquo; he added,
meaning the slang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have had a better!&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was real nice of you to ask us to come,&rdquo; put
in Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have enjoyed your company,&rdquo; said Laura,
and Flossie said the same. Then Mr. and Mrs.
Ford asked them to call again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come down to our school,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;On Saturdays we give a special drill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jack, you know, is our major!&rdquo; said
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pa, we must see the drill by all means!&rdquo;
cried the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can drive over some day,&rdquo; answered
the fond parent.</p>
<p>It was quarter to ten when the boys left the
grounds in the buggy. The lantern was lit and
hung over the dashboard, yet it did not light the
road very well, and they had to proceed with care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t so nice,&rdquo; observed Andy, when they
were in a black portion of the woods. &ldquo;Supposing
some tramps or highway robbers should
pounce out on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy must have been reading some trashy
five-cent library,&rdquo; laughed Pepper. &ldquo;I caught
Link Smiley reading one the other day, and I had
to laugh at all the hair-breadth escapes the so-called
hero had.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, but I&rsquo;m not giving up my good
nickels for such rot,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;Good
books are too plentiful. But it is dark and no
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a light ahead!&rdquo; interrupted Pepper.
&ldquo;Perhaps a carriage is coming this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove slowly, and presently came up to
where the light was resting, on a limb of a tree.
Just as they were opposite to the lantern, eight
masked figures leaped out from behind the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; was the command. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare
to drive another step!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What are we up against now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these fellows tramps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they going to rob us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were a few of the questions which Jack,
Andy, and Pepper asked when they found themselves
confronted by the eight masked figures on
the lonely forest road. Each of the masked persons
was armed with a stout stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, do you hear?&rdquo; came from one of the
crowd, and stepping forward, he caught the horse
by the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; demanded
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that you must consider yourself
prisoners,&rdquo; was the cold reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; queried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains for you to find out. Step down
out of that carriage and be quick about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we won&rsquo;t step out,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know them!&rdquo; shouted Jack. &ldquo;They must
be Pornell students. Roy Bock, I know your
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not Roy Bock,&rdquo; was the answer, in a
disguised voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are. What are you going to do with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to give you a lesson,&rdquo; growled
Roy Bock, for it was really he who had spoken.
&ldquo;Come down out of that buggy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bock spoke one of the boys leaped forward
and secured the whip and two others pulled away
the reins. There was no help for it, and Jack,
Pepper, and Andy had to leap out. They were at
once surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty high-handed proceeding,&rdquo;
said Jack, in a steady voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know we
can put you in the hands of the law for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; growled one of the masked students.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know Bock, and Grimes, and Gussie,&rdquo;
put in Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of them here,&rdquo; said one of the Pornell
boys. &ldquo;You are on to the wrong crowd entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this is a Baxter trick!&rdquo; whispered
Andy to his chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a Roy Bock trick, I am sure of it,&rdquo;
returned Jack. &ldquo;He is mad because we cut him
out with the Ford girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our friends were led to a small grove not far
from the roadside. Here a camp-fire was burning,
and they were forced to kneel while the
enemy stood around with their sticks upraised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to make a solemn promise,&rdquo;
said one of the masked students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What promise?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to visit Point View
Lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! I thought so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of you must promise not to go there
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not promise,&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me out too,&rdquo; came from Andy.
&ldquo;Why should we stay away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t promise?&rdquo; asked several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; came in unison from our three friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d rather suffer, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t intend to suffer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit talking and take them to the lake, fellows!&rdquo;
growled one of the masked students.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll sing another tune after they have been
ducked three or four times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going to duck us?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such is our intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mean trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can save yourself by promising to steer
clear of Point View Lodge in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing we are invited there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can plead a previous engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not do it,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; came from Jack and Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the lake with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of their resistance, our three friends
were hurried through the woods, to a point where
there was a small cove of the lake. Here a bent
tree overhung the water and here were several
ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tie them by the hands and feet and then
duck them good,&rdquo; said Roy Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must escape!&rdquo; whispered Jack to his
friends. &ldquo;When I give the word cut for it, and
cut lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; they answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be ducked than make any promises,&rdquo;
said Jack, loudly. &ldquo;But I want to tell you fellows
something. We have friends, and some day
we&rsquo;ll get square. The people&mdash;Gracious sakes
alive! What is that, fellows? Look, it&rsquo;s coming
this way! It must be a mad bull!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>As Jack broke off short and pointed with his
hand, all of the masked students looked in that
direction. Then Jack gave Pepper and Andy the
signal, and side by side they dove into the woods
and ran towards the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a trick, to get us to look away!&rdquo; roared
Roy Bock. &ldquo;Come on after them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come after us now we&rsquo;ll shoot somebody!&rdquo;
cried Andy. They had no firearms, but
he thought he might scare their enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will shoot?&rdquo; questioned
one of the masked boys, a lad who was timid by
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Grimes. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get hurt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; And then the
crowd went after Jack, Pepper, and Andy pell-mell.</p>
<p>But our friends had gained a good start and
they made the best possible use of their time. They
leaped over the rocks and small brush-wood, and
presently caught sight of the lantern, still hanging
over the dashboard of the buggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried Pepper, as he
stumbled over something. &ldquo;Bicycles, I declare,
four singles and two tandems!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have come to this spot on their
wheels,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea&mdash;we&rsquo;ll take a couple of the
wheels along! Then somebody will have to walk
home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreed to, and in a trice they had
hoisted two of the bicycles into the buggy. Then
they got in and urged the horse forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; came from behind. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have two of our wheels!&rdquo; came in
alarm, a moment later. &ldquo;They are driving away
with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us back our bicycles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night!&rdquo; shouted Jack. &ldquo;If you want
them, come to Putnam Hall to-morrow and get
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst yet!&rdquo; growled Roy Bock,
whose wheel had been taken. &ldquo;We must catch
them if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s do our best,&rdquo; returned Grimes,
whose wheel was likewise missing.</p>
<p>The rest of the boys mounted their wheels and
tried to follow the buggy. But the road to Putnam
Hall was much rougher than that to Pornell
Academy, and soon they had to abandon the pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made a mess of it,&rdquo; said Gussic. &ldquo;They
have the laugh on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like going to Putnam Hall for my
wheel,&rdquo; said Grimes, with a downcast look on his
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No more do I,&rdquo; answered Bock. &ldquo;But what
are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be sure to tell the Ford girls of this,
and they&rsquo;ll have the laugh on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do that, I&rsquo;ll punch somebody&rsquo;s head,&rdquo;
grumbled Roy Bock.</p>
<p>As soon as they were sure the Pornell students
had given up the pursuit, those in the buggy
slackened their pace, and re-arranged the bicycles
they were carrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely turned the tables on them that
time,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll stop
us again in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached Putnam Hall they placed
the bicycles in care of Peleg Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; where did you get them machines?&rdquo; demanded
the general utility man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to a couple of Pornell boys. We
picked &rsquo;em up on the road,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager a tomato you got into a scrap,&rdquo; said
Peleg, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we did, we didn&rsquo;t get the worst of it,
Peleg,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon you did. Most on the boys
at Putnam Hall knows how to take care o&rsquo; themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Our friends were curious to know what the
Pornell students would do about their wheels.
Two days passed, and then a hired man from the
Academy appeared with a wagon, and a note for
Jack. The note was unsigned and read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Please return the two bicycles per bearer, and
we will call the whole thing off.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s short enough,&rdquo; said Pepper, after Jack
had read the note aloud. &ldquo;What are you going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them have their wheels. It wouldn&rsquo;t be
honest to keep them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us send a note in return,&rdquo; suggested
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and without delay
he wrote out the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the future beware and keep off the grass.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Committee of Three</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s short and to the point,&rdquo; said Jack.
The note was sent with the bicycles; and that was
the last seen or heard of the Pornell boys for
some time to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A GREAT GAME OF FOOTBALL</span></h2>
<p>Once more the days glided by peacefully.
Autumn was now well under way, and the leaves
of the trees were turning to crimson and gold.
Boating became almost a thing of the past, and
talks about football filled the air.</p>
<p>With the coming of the football season Dale
Blackmore was in his element. Not only was
Dale a good athlete, but it was speedily learned
that he had been captain of a good amateur football
team in the town he hailed from, and that the
team had in one season won nine games out of
twelve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale is the man for our team,&rdquo; said Jack, and
by a popular vote the lad was made captain.
There was a slight opposition by Dan Baxter but
this quickly subsided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>As soon as he was made captain, Dale set to
work to organize as a good a team as Putnam
Hall could produce. He tried fully thirty cadets
and then selected fifteen&mdash;eleven for the regular
team and the balance as substitutes. On the regular
team were Jack, Andy, Hogan, Bart Conners,
Henry Lee, and others already mentioned in these
pages. Pepper was a substitute, and he was
willing enough to take a &ldquo;back seat&rdquo; as he
called it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we have got to get into practice,&rdquo; said
Dale, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s to be no baby play either.&rdquo; And
every day the team went out on the playground to
practice. Dale made a good coach, and soon had
the boys doing finely. He was assisted by George
Strong, who had himself played football on his
college team.</p>
<p>It had been expected that Pornell Academy
would play Putnam Hall. But the Pornell students
were sore over their boat-race defeat and
they insisted that a false start had been made.
The discussion grew warm on both sides, and so
the scheme for a football match for that year
fell through, although matches between the two
schools were played later, as I have already mentioned
in certain volumes of the &ldquo;Rover Boys
Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Pornell fellows are a sore lot,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;I suppose they felt sure they&rsquo;d win that
boat race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to play the Rigsby Football
Club next Saturday,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Dale just told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were to play Rigsby,&rdquo; put in
Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, some time later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rigsby Football Club was controlled by a
rich gentleman named Rigsby who had an elegant
place outside of a nearby city which I shall call
Mornville. The team was composed largely of
college boys and played exceedingly well.</p>
<p>The game between the Pornell Academy and
the Rigsby Club attracted a large crowd to Mornville,
and half a dozen students from Putnam
Hall journeyed to the town, to see what sort of a
game was being put up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must catch all the pointers we can,&rdquo; said
Dale. &ldquo;It may help us in our playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pornell Academy made a fine showing
during practice, but when the game started it was
quickly found that the Rigsby team was too heavy
and too clever for them. In each half of the game
the Rigsby Club made a touchdown and a goal,
and when the contest came to a close the score
stood, Rigsby 12, Pornell Academy 0.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as bad as the boat-race defeat,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;They must feel sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Rigsby chaps are heavy and full of
ginger,&rdquo; said Dale, seriously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no
picnic playing against them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>When our friends were coming from the football
grounds they fell in with half a dozen Pornell
students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine day, Bock!&rdquo; called out Pepper, cheerily.
&ldquo;Good day for playing football, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t crow!&rdquo; growled Roy Bock.
&ldquo;Just wait till Rigsby waxes you&mdash;you won&rsquo;t feel
so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they won&rsquo;t wax us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they!&rdquo; put in Grimes, who was along.
&ldquo;The score will be about 50 to nothing in Rigsby&rsquo;s
favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly; and then
the students of the two schools separated.</p>
<p>After this game the team of the Hall practiced
harder than ever, and George Strong taught them
several useful plays. So the days went by until
the eventful day for the match arrived. The game
was to come off on the Rigsby grounds, and the
students from Putnam Hall went over in the stage,
the carryall, and in carriages and on bicycles.</p>
<p>At first Dan Baxter said he was not going, but
when he heard how the Rigsby Club had defeated
Pornell Academy he changed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rigsby Club is sure to beat Dale Blackmore&rsquo;s
crowd,&rdquo; said he to Paxton and Coulter.
&ldquo;Let us go over there and see the drubbing administered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;Maybe
we can pick up a little money in bets.&rdquo; And
when they arrived on the football grounds all of
Baxter&rsquo;s cronies as well as the bully himself put
up money that Putnam Hall would be beaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just heard Baxter is betting against our
club,&rdquo; said Andy, coming in with the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How mean!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;To bet against
his own school! I don&rsquo;t believe in betting, but if
I did want to lay a wager, I&rsquo;d do it on my own
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how I feel about it,&rdquo; put in Pepper.
&ldquo;Well, I hope now, more than ever, that we
win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a fine ground, with a beautiful stand and
nice dressing rooms for both clubs. Mr. Rigsby
himself was at hand and shook each of the visitors
by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play for all you are worth, boys!&rdquo; he said,
cheerfully. &ldquo;I want the best club to win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to do our best, sir,&rdquo; said Dale,
modestly.</p>
<p>The halves were divided into thirty-five minutes
each, and soon the first half was on. It was Rigsby&rsquo;s
ball and they sent it twenty yards into Putnam
Hall territory. The Rigsby fellows were exceedingly
active, and inside of ten minutes they
scored a touchdown and immediately afterwards
kicked a goal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Rigsby! That&rsquo;s the way to do
it!&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putnam Hall will be defeated worse than Pornell
Academy was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the touchdown and goal were made Dan
Baxter grinned at Paxton and his other cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;This
is a dead easy thing for Rigsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; answered Paxton. &ldquo;Wish I
had another fiver up on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us do a little more betting,&rdquo; said Mumps,
who had just a dollar of his spending money left.</p>
<p>They walked into the crowd, and after some
trouble managed to place what money they had
left on the Rigsby team. Then they hurried back
to their seats. The first half of the game was
drawing to a close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another touchdown for Rigsby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Now for a goal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes! A goal, sure enough! How
do you like that, Putnam Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the score 12 to 0 the two teams went at
it again. But hardly had the leather been put into
play when the whistle blew and the first half came
to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are up against it sure, this trip,&rdquo; sighed
Andy. &ldquo;They can play like&mdash;like tigers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are too heavy for us, that is certain,&rdquo;
said Dale. &ldquo;We must depend upon our lightness
and our quickness if we want to win anything at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brief intermission was soon at an end, and
once more the two teams faced each other. The
Rigsby followers cheered wildly while the students
from Putnam Hall gazed expectantly.</p>
<p>It was soon seen that Dale&rsquo;s team was not playing
as before. There was little mass work, and
the ball flew from player to player with great
rapidity. This did not suit the Rigsby team, and
they made several errors and lost some ground
thereby.</p>
<p>Hardly had the second half been opened than
Joe Nelson got the ball. He passed it to Hogan,
who sent it to Andy. With a wild leap over a
Rigsby player, the acrobatic youth went flying
down the gridiron with the leather clutched in
his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Andy Snow running with the ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him, Brown! Stop him, Callahan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut him off, Sturmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the calls rang out and several started in pursuit
of Andy. But just as they thought they had
him he let the ball drop, gave it a swift kick, and
over the bar sailed the leather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! What a beautiful kick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on a dead run, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Putnam Hall is waking up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets cheered wildly and unfurled the flags
they had brought along, while some tooted their
horns.</p>
<p>As soon as possible the ball was put into play
once more. This time it went far up into Putnam
Hall territory, and it looked as if Rigsby would
score once more, when Hogan got the ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yit, me laddybuck!&rdquo; muttered the
Irish cadet, and started in the opposite direction.
He made twenty yards before he was downed and
the ball went to Joe Nelson, who carried it another
ten yards. Then Dale landed on it through a
fumble by Rigsby, and took it over the line for a
touchdown. A moment later there was a trial for
a goal, but it failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, it&rsquo;s a touchdown, anyway!&rdquo;
shouted the Putnam Hall supporters.</p>
<p>With the score 12 to 9 against them, Putnam
Hall went again at the battle. They had exactly
seven minutes in which to do or die, and the excitement
all over the field was now intense.
Among the anxious ones were Baxter and his
cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t win anything in seven minutes,&rdquo;
argued Paxton, somewhat gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it goes!&rdquo; cried Mumps. &ldquo;See, Rigsby
has the ball!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to score again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly looked like it, but at the last moment
Dale got the ball and sent it back. Then
it went from player to player so rapidly that the
Rigsby players could not follow it. At last Jack
had it and he ran with might and main for a touchdown&mdash;and
got it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop! Hurrah! Putnam Hall wins!&rdquo;
was the cry.</p>
<p>The goal was kicked, and the ball went again
into play. But before it could be moved ten yards
time was called; and the match came to an end.
Putnam Hall had indeed won.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">HAPPENINGS AFTER THE GAME</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What a splendid game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, but didn&rsquo;t the Putnam Hall boys pull
themselves together in that second half!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They surely did! I never saw such running
in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And such dodging, too! They deserve their
victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the talk ran on. Both Captain Putnam and
George Strong came up to congratulate the team
members.</p>
<p>Dan Baxter and his cronies were utterly downcast.
Between them they had lost sixteen dollars
and a half, and now some of them would have to
do without spending money for a long time to
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess those Rigsby chaps didn&rsquo;t want to
win,&rdquo; growled the bully. &ldquo;They went all to
pieces in the second half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was talking to Andy and Pepper when
Laura and Flossie Ford came up with smiling
faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was just splendid!&rdquo; cried Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just had to scream for you!&rdquo; added Flossie.
&ldquo;I was terribly anxious at first! Those Pornell
boys were sure you&rsquo;d be beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have disappointed them,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;I guess we could beat them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course. See how they were beaten
by Rigsby,&rdquo; said Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been bothered by Roy Bock
lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only once. Then he came and talked against
you, and pa told them&mdash;Roy and those others&mdash;they
had better stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Pepper, and told of the meeting
in the woods. The girls laughed heartily when
they heard how the bicycles had been taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming to see the drill next week,&rdquo;
said Laura. And they did come, and were entertained
to the best of our friends&rsquo; ability. They
thought the drill and parade fine, and complimented
Jack on the way he handled the
cadets.</p>
<p>As a substitute player, Pepper had gotten into
the second half of the football game, so he came
in for a portion of the glory, even though he had
made no brilliant plays. That night the boys
celebrated by a bonfire and by singing and &ldquo;larking&rdquo;
on the campus until eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, let them have their sport,&rdquo;
said George Strong. &ldquo;They certainly deserve
it.&rdquo; And the captain took the advice of his assistant.
Josiah Crabtree took no part in the proceedings,
but locked himself up in his room and
read. To his mind, all sports were just so much
time wasted.</p>
<p>On the following day one of the students
brought in news that interested all of the cadets.
A circus was to stop at Cedarville, and the boy
had brought one of the handbills along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks as if it might be a pretty good
show,&rdquo; said Pepper, after reading the handbill.
&ldquo;Andy, let&rsquo;s go if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think the captain will let us off,&rdquo; answered
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can sound him anyway,&rdquo; put in Jack.</p>
<p>The master of Putnam Hall was appealed to,
and finally said the big boys could go to the circus
if they wished, but all must promise to behave
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure we&rsquo;ll behave ourselves,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must have a little fun,&rdquo; came from
Pepper, with a wink at his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep out of mischief,&rdquo; put in Andy.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, the captain will put the screws on
us, and we won&rsquo;t get anywhere after this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>The circus soon became the chief topic of conversation,
and it was ascertained that twenty-one
of the older cadets were going. Dan Baxter
&ldquo;stuck up his nose&rdquo; at the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t catch me going to such a one-horse
affair,&rdquo; he said, with a sneer. &ldquo;When I go to a
circus it&rsquo;s only to the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get along very well without his company,&rdquo;
was Jack&rsquo;s comment, when he heard what
the bully had said.</p>
<p>On the following day Jack and Pepper walked
down to the lake shore and then up to a spot
where a large tree overhung the water. It was
sunny and fairly warm, and the two cadets took
a seat in the tree to chat and rest.</p>
<p>They had been sitting there less than five minutes
when the young major uttered a cry of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I am mistaken, there is that mysterious
sloop again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the lake! She is coming this way,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us keep out of sight and see if we can
discover anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>This was agreed to, and from behind the
boughs of the tree the two boys watched the
strange craft as it approached the shore where
Putnam Hall was located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same two men are on board!&rdquo; whispered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they are acting as they did before,
too,&rdquo; added Jack. &ldquo;Pep, I&rsquo;d give a good deal to
know what their game is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I. Let us lay low. We may learn
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the mysterious sloop approached the
shore and sailed past the Putnam Hall grounds.
The men on board looked eagerly toward the
academy buildings, and then went up the lake a
short distance. A few minutes later they came
back, and lowering the mainsail, drew close to
shore, a short distance from where Jack and Pepper
were in hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps our trip will be in vain again,&rdquo; said
one of the men to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot all be in vain,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;Some day we shall be successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But stand ready to sail when I come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>So speaking, one of the men leaped ashore and
stole behind a fringe of bushes. From that point
he made his way up to a spot back of the gymnasium,
and then walked completely around Putnam
Hall, taking care to keep out of sight of the
cadets who chanced to be roaming about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acts as if he was a robber!&rdquo; whispered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a robber would come here in
broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite a while before the man came back.
As he boarded the sloop again, his face showed
his disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another disappointment,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;Let us go. We may have better luck another
time.&rdquo; And without another word the two men
hoisted the mainsail of the sloop and sailed away
across Cayuga Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the odd things I ever heard of!&rdquo;
murmured Pepper. &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was wide
awake I&rsquo;d say I was dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are after something,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;The question is, what? I&rsquo;m rather sorry we
didn&rsquo;t call Peleg Snuggers and capture that fellow
who came ashore. Perhaps Captain Putnam
could get something out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go to the captain again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll think we are
only fooling him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>They talked the matter over, and decided to
say nothing more for the present. They watched
the sloop until it disappeared from view, and returned
to the school building.</p>
<p>The day for the circus dawned bright and
clear, and directly after the midday meal the long
stage belonging to the Hall was brought out and
the boys who were going to the show piled in.
They were in charge of George Strong, and
many carried small flags and horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Wildman&rsquo;s Great International
Circus!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Largest Aggregation
of Wild Beasts on the Globe! See the wild man
from Samoa, and the elephant-faced monkey
from Greenland! All for the one price of admission,
twenty-five cents&mdash;quarter of a dollar!
Walk up, crawl up, tumble up, anyway to get up,
ladies and gentlemen! Children half price, babies
no price at all. If you don&rsquo;t get your money&rsquo;s
worth, ask the manager to refund your hard-earned
savings! The show will be started at exactly
seventeen minutes past fourteen o&rsquo;clock.
The audience must come dressed in uniforms befitting
the occa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Pepper, you&rsquo;ll
have us wound up before we&rsquo;re started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All clocks are wound up before they are
started,&rdquo; retorted the Imp. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go on a
strike though, if you do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be so shamed that, like the clock, he&rsquo;ll
hide his face behind his hands,&rdquo; finished Andy.
&ldquo;Call it off, as the young lady said of the caterpillar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be just a little less enthusiastic,
young gentlemen,&rdquo; put in George Strong.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want this stage-load to be taken for
the cage of monkeys, you know.&rdquo; And then the
crowd settled down, Peleg Snuggers whipped up
the four horses, and off they rattled for the circus
grounds, located on the outskirts of Cedarville.</p>
<p>When they arrived they found the tents in position,
and a goodly crowd assembled. There
were the usual side shows and the usual stands
with peanuts, popcorn, and pink lemonade. There
was also a man with a little gambling game, surrounded
by a score of countrymen who thought
they could win, when they were certain to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if it might be a pretty good show,&rdquo;
remarked Andy, after the chums had entered the
tent devoted to the menagerie, and he was right.
The animals were not many in number, but they
had been selected with care, and George Strong
explained just what each was to those under his
guidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a particularly fine tiger,&rdquo; said he,
pointing the beast out as it paced up and down
its narrow cage. &ldquo;He looks as if he&rsquo;d enjoy his
liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he looks as if he&rsquo;d like to chew some of
us up,&rdquo; put in one of the students, and this created
a laugh.</p>
<p>It was soon time for the circus proper, and all
obtained good seats. One act after another passed
and was applauded, for all were very good. Then
came a chariot race, to wind up the performance.
This was in progress when there came a shout
from the menagerie tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the monkeys! They have broken
loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Somebody
said the monkeys were loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are there will be fun!&rdquo; murmured
Jack, and he was right. But how much fun he
was still to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE CIRCUS, AND A MONKEY</span></h2>
<p>The chariot race soon came to an end, and the
cadets passed into the menagerie tent once more.
Here there was considerable excitement. By accident
the monkeys had opened the door to their
big wagon cage, and fully a dozen of the little
creatures were missing. One monkey had climbed
into a cage containing two lions, and the kings of
the forest had made a meal of the wanderer in
double-quick order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s fun truly,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Wish I
could catch one of the little beggars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have your hands full, if Mr. Monk
was of the biting kind,&rdquo; returned Dale.</p>
<p>They watched the circus employees trying to
catch two of the monkeys, and then passed outside.
One of the monkeys had climbed clear to
the top of the flagpole on the circus tent and a
crowd of children were watching him with keen
delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the king-pin acrobat of the show!&rdquo;
cried Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody will dare go
after him,&rdquo; and so it proved. But the monkey
soon came down when shown some peanuts, and
was then placed back in his cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know what to do with his liberty
after he got it,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
wonder he didn&rsquo;t take to the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely he was born in captivity and
didn&rsquo;t know what liberty meant,&rdquo; came from Joe
Nelson. &ldquo;I knew some folks who had a tame
canary. For an experiment they took the bird to
the woods and opened the cage wide. Close by
the cage was a brook, and by the side of this they
put the canary&rsquo;s bath tub full of water. Would
you believe it, the canary always came back to his
cage to roost, and instead of dipping himself in
the brook, took his bath in his old tub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which showed what habit would do,&rdquo; said
another pupil. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know anything different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were soon in the stage, and Pepper
took his seat on the rear step, the stage itself being
crowded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall off, Master Ditmore,&rdquo; said George
Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear, you can&rsquo;t lose me so easily,&rdquo; replied
the fun-loving youth, and said this so merrily that
everybody had to laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>The stage was going along at a good gait when
Pepper happened to look under the turnout and
saw a sight that made him open his mouth wide
in astonishment. There, on the bar running from
the front to the back axle, sat a little monkey,
gazing around in wonder, with his face screwed
up into a curious pucker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; murmured Pepper to himself.
&ldquo;Have you been hiding there ever since
we left the circus grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the monkey saw that he was discovered,
he gave a little squeak, and hopped a
few inches away. Then he looked at Pepper in
added curiosity, as much as to say: &ldquo;What do
you want to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cute little chap,&rdquo; thought the cadet.
And then of a sudden he broke into a grin. What
fun might be had if he could capture that monkey!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he told himself, and feeling into
his pocket, he brought out a few peanuts. As soon
as the monkey saw these he came closer, snatched
one of the nuts, and proceeded to crack it
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to come into the stage,
Pep?&rdquo; called out Andy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make room for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can stay here,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like a private seat, you know.&rdquo; And then, when
he got the chance, he whispered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
reason for remaining here, but keep mum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on rattled the stage, the boys singing
and tooting their horns to pass the time. The
monkey did not appear to mind the noise, and evidently
enjoyed the ride. Luckily a slight shower
the night before had laid the dust, otherwise both
Pepper and the monkey might have been smothered.</p>
<p>At last they came in sight of the Putnam Hall
grounds, and then Pepper realized that something
must be done. He held out some more peanuts,
and when the monkey reached for them, he
caught the animal and held him fast, pushing him
inside his jacket. Then Pepper knocked off his
own cap into the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! there goes my cap!&rdquo; he called out,
and leaped to the ground. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for
me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk the rest of the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pep has lost his cap!&rdquo; cried several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, it&rsquo;s only a step to walk,&rdquo; came
from some others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to walk in with him,&rdquo; said Andy,
and leaped to the ground, followed by Jack. As
the three were known to be chums, nothing was
thought of this, and in a moment the stage disappeared
around a bend.</p>
<p>At first Pepper had his hands full holding the
monkey, and he was afraid he was going to be
bitten. But as Jack and Andy came up the creature
quieted down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; ejaculated the young
major. &ldquo;Where did you get the monk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was on the stage,&rdquo; explained Pepper.
&ldquo;Say, help me make him a prisoner, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; came from the others, and soon the
monkey had a cord tied around his waist. As
this was nothing new to him, he submitted without
much trouble, and when given half a dozen
more peanuts and a bit of candy Andy carried,
seemed quite content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with him?&rdquo; questioned
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Introduce him to old Crabtree,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; ejaculated Andy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
put him in Crabtree&rsquo;s room to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be some fun when the monk begins
to roam around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>After some talk, the boys decided to enter the
school by the back way. Jack went ahead to see
that the coast was clear, and soon they had the
animal safe in dormitory No. 4, over which the
youthful major presided. Then Andy found an
empty bird cage in the storeroom of the Hall, and
his monkeyship was transferred to this.</p>
<p>The evening was a long one to the boys, but it
finally came to an end, and they retired. Then,
when all the lights were out, Pepper and Andy
stole through the darkened hallways to the door
of Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s room. Listening intently,
they heard the first assistant teacher snoring
peacefully on his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the door unlocked?&rdquo; questioned Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said, and Pepper hurried back
for the bird cage containing the monkey, and also
for an old school-book he had brought up from
below.</p>
<p>Opening the door with caution, they took the
monkey from the cage and placed him at the foot
of Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s bed. Then they hurried to
the doorway once more, and went outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; whispered Pepper, and taking aim,
he sent the book flying at Josiah Crabtree. Then
the chums scampered for their dormitory with
might and main.</p>
<p>The book landed on Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s somewhat
bald head, and he awoke with a start and
sat up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world was that?&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Is the ceiling falling down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared around him. The moon was coming
up, and it cast considerable light into the apartment.
He saw a dark object moving around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Scat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking it might be a cat, he made a wild pass
at the monkey. At once the frisky animal caught
him by the finger and gave him a nip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; roared the teacher. &ldquo;He has bitten
me! Take him off! Help! Robbers! Help!&rdquo;
And he flung the bedclothes aside and began to
dance around.</p>
<p>At the excitement of the man the monkey also
became excited, and leaped upon the top of a bookcase
in a corner, which contained some volumes
belonging to the teacher. Down came a bust on
the bookcase with a crash. Then the monkey took
up a book and flung it at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; roared Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Help! There is a wild beast in the
room!&rdquo; And he ran around, with the monkey
following. Presently the animal leaped on his
shoulder, and then Josiah Crabtree let out a yell
as if a dozen wild Zulus were on his track.</p>
<p>The noise aroused the whole school. Doors
were flung open, and teachers, hired help, and
cadets came forth into the hallways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard somebody say robbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Crabtree!&rdquo; shouted Pepper. &ldquo;Somebody
must be trying to rob him. Come on, let us
catch the thief!&rdquo; And on the instant the cadets
stormed forward, towards the teacher&rsquo;s apartment,
and George Strong and Captain Putnam
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Scat, I tell you! Let me alone.
Don&rsquo;t pull my hair! Oh, will somebody take him
away!&rdquo; came from the room. &ldquo;This is simply
awful! Who put this beast here?&rdquo; and so the
cries ran on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is surely wrong,&rdquo; cried Captain
Putnam. &ldquo;Stand back, young gentlemen, or you
may get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung open the doorway, and as he did so,
Josiah Crabtree, robed in his nightdress, leaped
out, with the monkey on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you gone crazy?&rdquo; asked Captain Putnam.
And then he added: &ldquo;Where did that
monkey come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; roared Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;Take him off! He&rsquo;ll have my hair out by
the roots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty monkey!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Is
he your pet, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My pet? Never! Take him away!&rdquo; And the
teacher continued to dance around.</p>
<p>Several darted in to secure the monkey, but
like a flash the animal leaped to a fixture suspended
from the ceiling, and then swung himself
to a hall window and slipped outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose monkey is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have come over from the circus,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;They said a lot of them had gotten
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sue the circus proprietor for this!&rdquo; howled
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage on the public.
Oh, my poor head!&rdquo; And he ran back into his
room, banging the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the monkey gone?&rdquo; asked Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went through the window,&rdquo; answered Joe
Nelson.</p>
<p>They looked out of the window, but could see
nothing of the animal. Then some went below,
but the monkey had disappeared. He was captured
in the morning and returned to the circus
by Snuggers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen, you may retire,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam, and one after another the cadets did
so. Safe in Dormitory No. 4, Pepper told his
whole story, and the boys had a laugh that lasted
for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Crabtree won&rsquo;t get over that right
away,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;What a sight he did cut,
with Mr. Monk on his shoulder pulling his hair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word about this,&rdquo; came from Pepper.
&ldquo;If he found me out he&rsquo;d be mad enough
to chew my head off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are not telling on you,&rdquo; came from
one of the others. &ldquo;We are glad you fixed old
Crabtree. He deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">ALL ABOUT A TIGER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful, gents, really it is! As soon
as I heard the news, it made my knees shake like
they was made o&rsquo; jelly! Whatever are we goin&rsquo;
to do, with sech a wild animal as thet roamin&rsquo;
the roads, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Peleg Snuggers who was speaking. He
had just returned from an early morning trip to
Cedarville with the monkey, and was addressing
a little knot of cadets standing just outside of the
parade ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better git in the school,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t be safe to go outdoor no more. Ain&rsquo;t it
awful, though?&rdquo; And he shook his head solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Snuggers?&rdquo; questioned
Captain Putnam, who chanced to come up and
saw how disturbed his hired man was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about thet tagger as was at the circus,
sir,&rdquo; said Snuggers. &ldquo;Somehow or other, he
broke loose last night&mdash;knocked some o&rsquo; the bars
out o&rsquo; his cage. An&rsquo; they ain&rsquo;t found him
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tiger broke loose?&rdquo; queried the captain,
and now he was intensely interested. &ldquo;Who told
you of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chase, sir&mdash;an&rsquo; some circus folks. Cedarville
is wild with excitement, an&rsquo; none o&rsquo; the folks
dare to go outdoors. They say he&rsquo;s a powerful
tagger an&rsquo; mighty ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly was a big tiger,&rdquo; said Jack, who
was in the crowd. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t want to fall in
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he is coming this way,&rdquo; suggested one
of the smaller students, looking around nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me from meeting a tiger,&rdquo; said
Mumps, and without another word he walked
into the Hall and to his classroom.</p>
<p>The news spread with the rapidity of lightning,
and to be on the safe side, Captain Putnam ordered
all of the boys into the school and had all
the lower windows and doors closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly exciting enough,&rdquo; said Joe
Nelson. &ldquo;Supposing the tiger takes it into his
head to camp out around here? None of us will
want to go out any more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are bound to either catch him or
shoot him, sooner or later,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;But
just the same, I don&rsquo;t want to run afoul of that
beast. He looked strong enough to kill half a
dozen of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excitement was intense, and nobody dared
to venture far from the Hall. The cadets kept
a constant watch; but nothing came of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have news of the beast by this
time,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam on the following
morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive down to Cedarville and
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear captain don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; shrieked
Mrs. Green, the housekeeper. &ldquo;If you meet him
he&rsquo;ll eat you up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk that,&rdquo; returned the master of the
Hall, grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my rifle with me, and
also my seven-shooter. If I see the tiger I&rsquo;ll try
to give him a warm reception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;er&mdash;don&rsquo;t want me to drive you,
do you?&rdquo; asked Peleg Snuggers, in a trembling
voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t well this morning. I had
a&mdash;er&mdash;a dreadful backache all night, an&rsquo; a headache,
an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to drive, Snuggers. I&rsquo;ll take
the buggy and drive myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s flyin&rsquo; in the face of Providence,&rdquo; came
from Mrs. Green. &ldquo;Better wait a day or two
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going now. Hitch up Black Bess,
Snuggers. She is a steady mare, and won&rsquo;t run
away even if the tiger does show himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mare was hooked to the buggy, and Captain
Putnam looked carefully to his rifle and his
old army revolver. The excitement of the occasion
was just to his liking. It put him in mind of
his days in the wild west, and he half wished the
escaped tiger would show itself so that he might
get a shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain certainly has grit,&rdquo; remarked
Jack, as the master of the Hall drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind going with him,&rdquo; came
from Dale. &ldquo;I like hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this isn&rsquo;t ordinary hunting,&rdquo; put in
Andy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wildest kind of game to bring
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the captain was out of sight all began
to wait anxiously for his return. The cadets
could scarcely settle themselves to their studies,
and more than one failed utterly in his lessons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is wretched!&rdquo; cried Josiah Crabtree,
wrathfully. &ldquo;I shall keep all of you in after regular
hours!&rdquo; He had not gotten over his adventure
with the monkey, and was feeling more sour
than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t forget the tiger,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tiger is not here,&rdquo; snapped the crabbed
teacher. &ldquo;Attend to your lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a teacher!&rdquo; murmured Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix him,&rdquo; whispered Pepper. &ldquo;Wait till
he passes that open window again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Josiah Crabtree walked by the
window in question. His back was toward it, and
on the instant Pepper arose and pointed at the
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Is that the tiger?&rdquo; he cried, shrilly.</p>
<p>At the words Josiah Crabtree sprang a foot
into the air and dodged into a corner. All of the
cadets leaped to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did you&mdash;see the tiger?&rdquo; questioned
the teacher, faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the tiger?&rdquo; roared several boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be trying to come into the window,&rdquo;
shouted Andy, catching the spirit of the
joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ke&mdash;ke&mdash;keep him ou&mdash;ou&mdash;out!&rdquo; spluttered
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;Do&mdash;don&rsquo;t let him get
in here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gone now,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Must have
been something else!&rdquo; And he winked broadly
at his friends, so that none of them might be
alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;you sure, Ditmore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; murmured Josiah Crabtree,
wiping the cold perspiration from his forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can study anyway,&rdquo; murmured Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt our studying, Mr. Crabtree.
You can watch for the tiger while we do our
sums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; roared the crabbed teacher, but
after that he said little about the poor lessons.</p>
<p>By noon Captain Putnam came back, and the
cadets at once surrounded him to learn what he
might have to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw nothing of the tiger,&rdquo; said the master
of the Hall. &ldquo;A number of parties went out
after him yesterday, and one crowd discovered
the beast near the lake. They fired on him and
he started to swim away. They think he must
have been drowned, although they have not yet
located the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope he was drowned,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>The matter was talked over for the balance of
that day, and also the next. Then came in news
that the circus people were also certain the tiger
had gone to the bottom of Cayuga Lake, and
everybody breathed easier. The circus moved
southward, and soon the excitement died down
completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Our young friends had not forgotten the
Fords, and having received another invitation to
call at the mansion at Point View Lodge, they
set off one afternoon as soon as they could get
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t have another encounter with
those Pornell Academy fellows,&rdquo; said Jack, as
they drove along in the buggy the captain
had let them have. &ldquo;One such mix-up was
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they haven&rsquo;t forgotten how they
fared on that occasion,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;They
promised to call it off, if you&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they did, but I shouldn&rsquo;t take their word
for it,&rdquo; put in Pepper.</p>
<p>They arrived at the Ford mansion without mishap,
having met absolutely nobody on the road.
Laura and Flossie were there, and also Mrs. Ford
and a niece from Rochester, and all did what they
could to make the time pass pleasantly for the
boys. They played croquet and lawn tennis, and
went out for a short row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys can certainly handle the oars,&rdquo; said
Laura, with a sunny smile. &ldquo;I wish I could row
half as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s practice that does it,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;Now, all of you girls can play croquet better
than we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The party of girls and cadets was just returning
to the house when they heard a loud scream
coming from the direction of the road running to
Point View Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what does that mean?&rdquo; cried Jack,
stopping short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is in trouble!&rdquo; came from Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! save me!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;Save me!
I&rsquo;ll be eaten up alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong, fellows. Come on!&rdquo;
ejaculated Jack, and ran forward, catching up an
oar as he spoke. The others followed, one with
another oar, and Andy with a boathook. They
were just in time to see a colored woman, who
was the cook at the mansion, flying into a side
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, pointing
down the road. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the tiger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tiger!&rdquo; echoed Pepper, and all of the
girls set up a scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there he is&mdash;crouching by the side of
yonder tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;Quick, girls, get
into the house before he comes this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in! Come in!&rdquo; roared the colored
cook. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll eat you all up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>As fast as they could the girls ran for the mansion,
entering by a back door. The cadets followed.
Looking back they saw the tiger moving
slowly from the vicinity of the tree to a clump of
bushes on the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly coming this way,&rdquo; called out
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is moving for the house, too!&rdquo; put in
Pepper. &ldquo;There he goes around to the kitchen
door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepper spoke the truth. The tiger had reached
the back door. Now he bounded up the small
stoop, and a second later entered the kitchen of the
mansion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">PRISONERS OF A WILD BEAST</span></h2>
<p>As soon as they could do so the three cadets
ran into the side door of the mansion. They
found the girls on an upper landing, gazing down
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the tiger coming?&rdquo; called down Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s in the kitchen,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kitchen!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Ford, who had
come out of the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, save me, somebody!&rdquo; came from the
rear of the mansion, and the butler appeared, with
his hair almost on end. &ldquo;A wild beast, mum&mdash;roaming
the pantry, mum,&rdquo; he spluttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go upstairs, all of you,&rdquo; said Jack, as
he heard the tiger leap upon a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the cook, and
ran to the top of the house, followed by the butler,
where both locked themselves in their rooms.</p>
<p>The girls and Mrs. Ford were soon on the second
floor of the mansion, and the three cadets
followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shut all of the doors tight, Mrs. Ford,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;For all we know, he may take it into his
head to come upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Jack&rsquo;s directions, the doors were
closed, and the family gathered in a large room
in the front of the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever are we to do?&rdquo; questioned Laura,
helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can stay here,&rdquo; answered her sister.
&ldquo;That is what I am going to do for the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Joseph?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ford. The
man she mentioned was the gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone to town to have the lawn mower
repaired,&rdquo; answered Laura. She turned to Jack.
&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t this dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got anything in the way of a gun or
a pistol, Mrs. Ford?&rdquo; questioned the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband keeps a pistol in his bedroom.
I can get it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to risk going after the tiger?&rdquo;
asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pistol won&rsquo;t fetch him,&rdquo; put in Pepper.
&ldquo;He looks as tough as a boarding-house steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to investigate, and I&rsquo;ll feel safer with
the pistol,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>The weapon was soon brought and the young
major saw that it was ready for use. It looked
as if it might do considerable damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep all the doors but this one shut,&rdquo; said
Jack, and then tiptoed his way into the hall once
more. He looked down the stairs and along the
lower hallway, but could see nothing of the tiger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you making out?&rdquo; questioned Pepper,
coming out behind him with a bed slat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see anything yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy came out into the hallway also, and the
three listened intently. All was quiet outside and
not a sound came from the lower floor of the
mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he went outside again,&rdquo; whispered
Andy. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be natural for him to stay
indoors. Tigers love to roam the forest, and lay
in wait for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear him!&rdquo; interrupted Pepper. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All listened again, and now they could hear the
creature moving from the kitchen into the library,
and then to the parlor. A discord on the piano
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, he is trying the piano!&rdquo; cried Pepper,
and grinned. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll play us a waltz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the parlor the tiger roamed into the library,
and then showed his head in the hallway
for an instant. But before Jack could take aim
the beast had disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is making himself at home,&rdquo; muttered the
young major. &ldquo;Wish I could get a chance at
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes again!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and at
that moment the tiger came out into the hall and
turned partly around.</p>
<p>Jack had his pistol ready, and taking a quick
aim, he pulled the trigger. There was a flash and
a report, in the semi-dark hallway, and the tiger
gave a snarl of pain. Then he glanced up the
stairs, glared at the cadets, and came up four
steps at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the room, quick!&rdquo; yelled Jack, and
blazed away twice in rapid succession. The tiger
was struck in the fore leg, and came to a pause
close to the top of the stairs. Jack fired one more
shot, then followed his chums into the room, and
the door was closed and locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hit him?&rdquo; queried several, in concert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did, but I don&rsquo;t know how badly
he is wounded. Mrs. Ford, have you any cartridges
for this pistol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the lady of the mansion, and
brought forth a box half full. Without loss of
time, Jack filled up the empty chambers of the
pistol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is snarling outside of the door!&rdquo; cried
Laura. &ldquo;Oh, do you think he&rsquo;ll try to break
down the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before anybody could answer there came a wild
snarl, and then a thump on the barrier that almost
took the door from its hinges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get into the next room,&rdquo; called out
Pepper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll break in here if he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us move the bed against the door,&rdquo; suggested
Andy.</p>
<p>The bed was a large affair, of solid mahogany,
and would prove an excellent barrier, but before
it could be rolled into position there came a crash,
and the tiger&rsquo;s head appeared through a portion
of one of the door panels.</p>
<p>Crack! crack! went the pistol in Jack&rsquo;s hand,
and as quickly as he had appeared the tiger disappeared,
with a wound in the jaw and another
along the left ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that will teach him to keep his distance,&rdquo;
said the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to the front of the house,&rdquo; cried
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The upper veranda! He is going out on the
upper veranda!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come through the windows!&rdquo; burst
from Flossie&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Let us go to another room,
mamma!&rdquo; And the girls and their mother did so.
Andy and Pepper looked inquiringly at Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A few more shots ought to make him tired of
living,&rdquo; said the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try the pistol on him,&rdquo; came from
Pepper, and having secured the weapon, he
peeped out into the hallway. The tiger stood at
the front end, gazing at the upper veranda and
beyond.</p>
<p>Pepper was not an extra shot, but the bullet
took the tiger in the left hind knee, and made him
utter a fierce snarl. He leaped out on the veranda,
and then made another leap into the
branches of a nearby tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has taken to the tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me give him a shot too,&rdquo; pleaded Andy,
and having received the pistol, he awaited his opportunity,
and blazed away, hitting the beast in
the side. There was a snarl, and the tiger fell
to the grass, rolling over and over in evident
pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the
shots that told! Give him another, Andy!&rdquo; and
the cadet did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this shooting about?&rdquo; came from
the roadway, and Mr. Ford appeared, in company
with his gardener. &ldquo;Gracious! Where did that
tiger come from?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one that got away from the circus
the other day!&rdquo; called down Jack. &ldquo;Look out,
there may be some fight left in him yet, although
we have peppered him pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw down the pistol and I&rsquo;ll finish him,&rdquo;
said the gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us finish him, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; pleaded Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you can do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three of the cadets went down the front
stairs with a rush, while the girls and Mrs. Ford
came out on the upper balcony. Pepper fired one
shot, Jack a second, and Andy a third. The last
was too much for his tigership, and with a final
quiver he rolled over, stretched out, and lay
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;he dead?&rdquo; asked the gardener cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; answered Mr. Ford. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t go near him yet&mdash;he may be shamming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited a few minutes, and then Jack
went up carefully and made an examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead as a barn door!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;My,
what a big fellow he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain he is dead?&rdquo; faltered Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any more of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the only one that got loose,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Thus assured, the girls and Mrs. Ford came
downstairs, followed later by the butler and the
cook. The latter was still trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we was goin&rsquo; to be eat up suah!&rdquo;
said the cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great happening, sir,&rdquo; said the
butler. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t abide wild beasts, sir, not me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have the skin of this tiger,&rdquo;
said Jack to Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;It would make a fine
rug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma, let us have the skin by all
means,&rdquo; pleaded Laura. &ldquo;We can have it fixed
up with the head on, and it will look beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to see the circus people about it,&rdquo;
came from Mr. Ford. &ldquo;Tell me how he happened
to come here.&rdquo; And then all told their
stories, to which the gentleman listened closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad these young men were here,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;Had we been alone, I do not
know what might have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger was dragged to a carriage shed by
the gardener and the boys, and then the cook was
sent off to get dinner ready. It was found that
outside of eating up some steaks, drinking a pan
of milk, and breaking a few dishes, the tiger had
done no damage. Every bullet aimed at him had
taken effect, and there were also two old wounds
on him, in the leg and side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must have gotten these old wounds when
he leaped into the lake,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;But
it was a mistake to report him drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I ever want to meet another
tiger at large,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;They are too dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Snow,&rdquo; answered Mr. Ford. &ldquo;You
can all be thankful that he did not get at you. If
he had, he might have made mince-meat of one
or another in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">OFF ON A LONG MARCH</span></h2>
<p>When the boys returned to Putnam Hall and
told about their adventure with the tiger, they
were proclaimed genuine heroes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly deserve a great deal of credit,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam. &ldquo;Just the same, had I
known the tiger was still at large, I should have
kept you at the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on, the circus authorities were communicated
with, and from them Rossmore Ford
obtained the skin of the beast, and had it prepared,
with the head on, for a rug; and it is in his
mansion on the floor to this day.</p>
<p>The cadets of Putnam Hall were now getting
ready for an outing to last several days. Before
winter set in, the captain wished to give them a
taste of camp life, and so decided to make a
march to a beautiful valley some twenty miles
away. Here the boys were to go into camp for
two nights, returning on the next day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I&rsquo;ll like!&rdquo; exclaimed Stuffer
Singleton. &ldquo;No lessons to study. Only to
march, get up an appetite, and eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially eat!&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;That hits
Stuffer every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to go on army rations,&rdquo; put in Pepper,
with a wink at his chums. &ldquo;Pork and
beans, and hard-tack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Stuffer in alarm. &ldquo;Who
told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everybody knows it,&rdquo; put in Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that you get all the hard-tack you
want, Stuffer,&rdquo; went on Pepper. &ldquo;The captain
won&rsquo;t want you to go hungry, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any hard-tack,&rdquo; growled Stuffer,
in disgust. &ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d get the same kind of
feed as we get here.&rdquo; The march had suddenly
lost all of its interest for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better take some private rations along,&rdquo; suggested
another cadet. &ldquo;A loaf of bread, or some
dried herrings, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re joking!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy who
loved to eat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask Mr. Strong,&rdquo;
and off he ran, while the others set up a loud
laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>It was a cool, crisp morning when the battalion
started. The cadets made a fine showing in their
clean, neat uniforms, with buttons and buckles
polished to the last degree. Major Jack was at
the head of the column, and he was certainly
proud of his position, and had a right to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoulder arms, forward, march!&rdquo; was the
command given, and the drums sounded out, and
the column moved off. A few people were present
to see them march away, and these gave a
cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no nicer school in these United
States!&rdquo; exclaimed Peleg Snuggers, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Them boys is the real thing, right
straight through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; nice boys, too,&rdquo; added Mrs. Green.
&ldquo;God bless &rsquo;em, every one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first mile the route was along the lake
shore. Then the battalion turned to the westward,
and were soon pursuing a road that wound in and
out among the hills. The cadets passed through
several small villages, and the inhabitants came
out to gaze at them in wonder, while the small
boys set up a cheer.</p>
<p>One of the villages had just been left behind,
when those in the front of the line of march
heard a loud tooting from an automobile horn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes one of those big autos,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s coming at a spanking gait,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope it gives us plenty of room,&rdquo; came from
another cadet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to meet those big
machines, when they are going at a twenty-mile
clip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>The automobile was coming around a turn of
the road, and soon it was almost on top of Company
A. The cadets were marching on the right
side of the road, but the automobile crowded
them closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there, keep to your side of the road!&rdquo;
shouted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Halifax!&rdquo; growled the man who was
running the machine, a big burly fellow, with a
red face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t keep to your side of the road
there will be trouble,&rdquo; answered Jack, sharply,
and then the young major commanded the battalion
to halt. He was in sole charge, Captain
Putnam and his assistants having gone ahead to
arrange for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, young fellow, you can&rsquo;t bulldoze
me, even if you are in soldier clothes!&rdquo;
stormed the man, bringing his machine to a
standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Carl!&rdquo; pleaded a lady who sat
on the rear seat of the automobile. &ldquo;Let us go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want him to understand he can&rsquo;t bulldoze
me, Annie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not trying to bulldoze you, sir,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;We are entitled to half the roadway,
and we are going to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel big, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; sneered the automobilist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to give us half the road or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them what they want, Carl!&rdquo; pleaded
the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give them half the road,&rdquo; growled the
man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to run my wheels into the
soft ground for anybody. I might get stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can give us half the road and not get
stuck either,&rdquo; returned Jack. He knew a little
about running an automobile himself.</p>
<p>The machine was standing almost in the
middle of the road. Somewhat to the right was
a puddle of water, and had the cadets marched
around the machine, they would have had to go
directly through the wet spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect us to march through that
puddle?&rdquo; demanded the young major, after a
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can break ranks and go around the other
way,&rdquo; answered the man. He evidently wanted
to make as much trouble for the young soldiers as
he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are not breaking ranks for that purpose.&rdquo;
Jack&rsquo;s face was growing white. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
just two minutes in which to get out of the road.
Now be quick, and move on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! do you intend to dictate to me?&rdquo;
growled the man, but looked just a bit anxious.</p>
<p>For reply the young major got out his watch.
At the same time he turned to the two companies
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Support arms!&rdquo; was the command. &ldquo;Fix
bayonets!&rdquo; And at the last word the cadets drew
their shining bayonets from their scabbards and
fastened them to their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carl, do move to one side!&rdquo; cried the
lady, in terror. &ldquo;They are going to charge on
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! don&rsquo;t you charge!&rdquo; yelled the man.
He knew only too well what bayonets could do
to the rubber tires of his automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is up,&rdquo; called out Major Jack. &ldquo;Are
you going to get to your side of the road or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pic3.png" alt="&ldquo;ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO YOUR SIDE OF THE ROAD OR NOT?&rdquo;" width="500" height="792" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO YOUR SIDE OF THE ROAD OR NOT?&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; grumbled the man, and
turning on the power, he moved to one side, and
passed the two companies with ease. Several
made imitation charges on his rubber tires as he
passed, much to his alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a brute!&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment, as the
cadets moved on once more. &ldquo;I suppose he
wanted the whole road to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A good many folks who own autos forget
that other folks have rights on the road which
they are bound to respect,&rdquo; answered Joe Nelson.
&ldquo;If they had their way, they&rsquo;d ride over everything
and everybody that came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short distance further on, the battalion came
to another village, and here the young soldiers
stopped for dinner. Without loss of time Jack
reported to Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you had trouble,&rdquo; said the owner
of the Hall. &ldquo;You did right to demand half the
road. If you have more trouble, let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner was had under some large spreading
chestnut trees. It was plain but wholesome, and
the long morning march had given everybody a
good appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you enjoying your hard-tack, Stuffer?&rdquo;
asked Pepper, with a wink at the always-hungry
cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I knew you fellows were only
fooling,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock the march was resumed, and
kept up until half-past five. They had now
reached a spot known as Squire&rsquo;s Grove, and here
tents were pitched in true military style. Big
fires were started, and the cadets had their first
taste of camp life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, but I&rsquo;d like about a month of this,&rdquo; was
Andy&rsquo;s comment, after each cadet had been assigned
to his quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we couldn&rsquo;t have some fun!&rdquo; put in
Pepper. &ldquo;As it is, I&rsquo;m going to try for some
fun to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air was so cool in the evening that the
cadets were glad enough to gather around the
big camp-fires. They told stories, and sang
songs, and all too quickly came the hour to turn
in.</p>
<p>As Captain Putnam wanted the students to
learn what real military life was like, each cadet
was assigned to two hours of guard duty during
the night. As soon as he heard of this, Pepper
learned where Mumps would be stationed, and
then called Andy to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that ghost story Dale was telling?&rdquo;
he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I did. It fairly made some of the
younger lads tremble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice how scared Mumps was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mumps is going to see a ghost to-night,
Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because we are going to fix one up for him,&rdquo;
and then Pepper unfolded a plan that had just
entered his head. It met with instant approval,
and soon the two boys started to carry it out.</p>
<p>Taking a tree branch they wrapped it up in a
white sheet, and on the top placed a white duck
cap, making the whole look like the ghost of a
cadet while at a distance. Then they took this
out of camp, and placed it at the end of a strong
cord, running up over the limb of a tree. The
figure was pulled up among the branches, out of
sight, and this done they sought out Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mumps, was it you told the fellows that
a cadet was once murdered around here?&rdquo; questioned
Pepper, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered?&rdquo; returned the sneak of the
school. &ldquo;No, I never heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say a cadet was murdered at this place
about four years ago, and that if you watch
for it, you can see his ghost among the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you can&rsquo;t scare me,&rdquo; returned Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to scare you. I thought you
told the story yourself,&rdquo; was the answer, and
then Andy and Pepper strolled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll remember that, I&rsquo;ll wager,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know better when he goes on guard,&rdquo;
answered Andy, and then they waited impatiently
for the time to come when they could work off
their little joke on the sneak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">MUMPS SEES A GHOST</span></h2>
<p>As luck would have it, Pepper and Andy went
on guard from ten o&rsquo;clock to midnight, while
Mumps had his time set from midnight to two in
the morning.</p>
<p>As soon as they came in from guard duty, Pepper
and Andy told a few of their chums of what
was in the air, and they all stole from their tents
to a spot overlooking the ground that Mumps
would have to cover during the next two
hours.</p>
<p>The sneak was already on duty, pacing up and
down slowly, with his gun on his shoulder. He
had to march from one tree in the grove to
another, a distance of two hundred feet.</p>
<p>As the sneak passed the tree where the white
figure was concealed, Pepper, who was close at
hand, uttered a low and unearthly groan.</p>
<p>At once Mumps came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>For reply Pepper uttered another groan, and
Andy followed with a sound like that of a dying
calf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; repeated the sneak.
All was so dark and strange around him that he
felt anything but comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; moaned Pepper. &ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; put in Andy, in a solemn tone.
&ldquo;Oh, to be avenged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when Mumps&rsquo; back was turned Pepper
allowed the white figure to drop to within a
foot of the ground. As it was light in weight,
the breeze made it sway slowly from side to
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; came from Andy and Pepper
together.</p>
<p>At this blood-curdling laugh the sneak of the
school turned around once again. When he saw
the swaying figure in white his teeth began to
chatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ple&mdash;please go&mdash;go a&mdash;away!&rdquo; he
groaned. &ldquo;G&mdash;go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; went on Pepper and Andy.
&ldquo;Down on thy knees, if thou wouldst live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; screamed Mumps, and fell on his
knees. &ldquo;Oh, please, don&rsquo;t kill me! I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t
have anything to do with killing that other fellow,
indeed I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art doomed!&rdquo; went on the Imp and his
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doomed! doomed! doomed!&rdquo; came from
half a dozen. All of the cadets could scarcely
keep from laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, save me!&rdquo; yelled Mumps, and sprang to
his feet. &ldquo;Save me! Save me from the
ghost!&rdquo; And throwing down his gun he started
for the center of the camp, with all the speed at
his command.</p>
<p>The other cadets set up a laugh, but the sneak
was too paralyzed with fear to pay attention to
it. Still yelling for help he ran down the main
street of the camp, and plunged into the tent occupied
by Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; came from Captain
Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the ghost! Please save me from the
ghost, Captain Putnam!&rdquo; howled Mumps, and
clutched the master of the Hall by the arm.
&ldquo;Save me! The ghost is going to kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Master Fenwick, what is the trouble?
Have you a nightmare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. It&rsquo;s the ghost of the murdered
cadet! I&mdash;I saw it. It came after me! Oh,
save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You have seen no ghost. Be
reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did see it, sir. It was all white, and it was
going to kill me!&rdquo; And the sneak clung tighter
than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is some trick.&rdquo; The captain slipped
into his clothes, and turned up a lantern hanging
on a tent post. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll investigate. Come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; whined Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be, Fenwick. I&rsquo;ll protect you.
Come along. There are no such things as
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fully five minutes before Captain Putnam
could get the sneak to accompany him to the
spot where the latter had been doing guard duty.
In the meantime the whole camp had been
aroused, and Pepper and Andy had folded up the
sheet and put it away, along with the cap and the
cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself that there is nothing
here, Fenwick,&rdquo; said the captain, gazing around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw it, Captain Putnam. A tall white
figure, right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I saw it, I am certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An investigation was made, but, of course,
nothing out of the ordinary was brought to light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go back to your duty, Fenwick,&rdquo;
said the master of the Hall at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir&mdash;supposing that ghost comes again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run up and catch hold of it. You&rsquo;ll likely
find it some joke the other cadets have played on
you,&rdquo; and Captain Putnam smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke!&rdquo; Mumps looked interested. &ldquo;Do
you think it was a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it looked so real!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost can&rsquo;t look real. You have been deceived.
Go back to your duty,&rdquo; and the master
of Putnam Hall returned to his tent, and Mumps
resumed his guard duty, with a heart that trembled
every time he took a step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! but that was rich!&rdquo; laughed Andy,
when the affair was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about being scared,&rdquo; returned Pepper.
&ldquo;I was afraid he would have a regular fit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more fun that night. Poor Hogan
was tossed in a blanket, and Dan Baxter had
three frogs placed between the blankets of his
cot. Our friends did not escape, for in the morning
Pepper found a sharp burr in one shoe, and
Andy found the sleeves of his coat tied into hard
knots. Jack was minus his shoes, which were
finally located dangling from the limb of a tree
back of his tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Major Ruddy has planted a shoe
tree!&rdquo; cried one of the cadets. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind
having some seed, major. I&rsquo;d like to grow a
pair of slippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not try some lady-slipper seed,&rdquo; suggested
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slipper the chap that put my shoes up
there, if I can find him,&rdquo; grumbled Jack.</p>
<p>At breakfast there was more fun. Dan Baxter&rsquo;s
crowd was preparing a pot of coffee when
Pepper, watching his chance, dropped a piece of
soap into the pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! but this is rank coffee!&rdquo; came from
Paxton, spitting out a mouthful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vilest I ever tasted,&rdquo; came from Coulter.
&ldquo;Say, Dan, did you make that out of stale glue,
or old boots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough coffee for anybody,&rdquo; grumbled
the bully. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, make it
yourself after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took a deep gulp, just to show them
he was not afraid to drink it. A wry face followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, eh?&rdquo; came from Paxton, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular Waldorf-Astoria brand,&rdquo; put in
Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got in the pot,&rdquo; cried the bully,
and poured the coffee into a big pan that was
handy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? A cake of soap, I declare!
Who put that there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me from drinking soap coffee,&rdquo;
grunted Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Dan Baxter&rsquo;s crowd is drinking soap
coffee!&rdquo; shouted one of the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like the flavor, Dan?&rdquo; asked
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than Java, eh?&rdquo; came from a third
cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of all sorts of tastes in coffee,
but I never heard of soap being used before,&rdquo;
was Pepper&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter&rsquo;s afther wantin&rsquo; a good wash on th&rsquo;
insoide!&rdquo; came from Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you fellows shut up!&rdquo; growled the bully,
and taking the chunk of semi-soft soap, he hurled
it at Pepper. But the Imp dodged, and the soap
landed in Mumps&rsquo; left eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; howled the sneak. &ldquo;Oh! you
have put out my eye! Oh!&rdquo; And he began to
dance around wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mean to hit you, Mumps,&rdquo; said Baxter.
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he called out; &ldquo;who put that
soap in the coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a riddle,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;A
lima bean to the one who solves it last.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee in the soap is good for warts,&rdquo; said
Dale, with a grin, for Baxter&rsquo;s hands were
covered with warts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get square!&rdquo; growled the
bully; and there the talk had to come to an end.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, there was a long drill, and then
the cadets were allowed to do as they pleased for
several hours. Some wandered through the
woods, while others went to a nearby brook to
fish. Half a dozen of Baxter&rsquo;s crowd went off
through the woods by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they going?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and don&rsquo;t much care,&rdquo; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>Baxter&rsquo;s crowd walked through the woods to
where there was a farmhouse, and there stopped
to get some apples and some milk. While stopping
at the place they got into conversation with
the farmer&rsquo;s daughter, a pleasant-looking damsel
of eighteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a beauty,&rdquo; said Coulter.</p>
<p>Baxter followed the farmer&rsquo;s daughter to the
dairy, and began to talk to her in a pleasant way.
Then he tried to put his arm around her waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; she said sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give me just one kiss?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you&mdash;this!&rdquo; she answered quickly,
and, taking up a can of sour milk, she threw it
directly into his face. Then she ran into the
house, shrieking with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan got it that time!&rdquo; said Paxton, with a
snicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was real sweet, too!&rdquo; added Coulter.</p>
<p>Wild with rage, Baxter wiped the sour milk
from his face and hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you for that!&rdquo; he roared, and started
to go into the house, but the girl appeared with
a broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep away!&rdquo; she cried, shrilly. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll set our dog on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on away!&rdquo; put in Mumps, in
alarm. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; And he hurried towards
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we had better go,&rdquo; whispered Coulter.
&ldquo;If the farmer should report us to Captain
Putnam, there would be the Old Nick to pay,&rdquo;
and he too walked off, with Paxton and the sneak
beside him. Seeing there was no help for it,
Baxter withdrew, the girl laughing merrily at
him as he did so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE YOUNG MAJOR SHOWS HIS COURAGE</span></h2>
<p>All too soon for the young cadets the encampment
in the grove came to an end, and the march
back to Putnam Hall was taken up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gives us a taste of what the annual encampment
will be like,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;My, but
won&rsquo;t we have just boss times!&rdquo; And his face
glowed with anticipation.</p>
<p>The day was positively cold, and the young
soldiers were glad enough to march along briskly.
Mile after mile was covered, until they came to
the place where they had taken dinner when coming
from the Hall.</p>
<p>While they were resting Jack and Pepper fell
in with a boy of the neighborhood, who was riding
a bicycle. The boy asked them about life at
the Hall, and in return they questioned him about
his wheeling trips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can try my wheel if you wish,&rdquo; said the
youth to them, and Pepper took a short spin up
the road and back. Then Jack turned his sword
over to his chum and hopped into the saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The seat isn&rsquo;t quite high enough for me,&rdquo;
said the young major. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a good wheel
and I feel as if I could pedal ten or twenty miles
without half trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had gone quite a distance down the road
when he heard a whirring sound, and looking in
the direction, saw an automobile approaching.
It was coming at good speed, and swaying from
side to side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, I&rsquo;ll have to get out of the way, or
run the risk of being run over,&rdquo; he said to himself,
and drew up near a stone fence.</p>
<p>As the automobile came closer he saw that it
contained only a lady and a little girl. The lady
was holding on to the steering wheel with one
hand, and holding the girl with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, help!&rdquo; she cried out, as the automobile
passed Jack. &ldquo;Help! I cannot stop the
machine!&rdquo; And then she passed by in a cloud of
dust.</p>
<p>For the moment Jack did not comprehend.
Then he shut his teeth hard, turned around, and
raced after the automobile on the bicycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to stop that machine for her if I
can!&rdquo; he reasoned. &ldquo;I suppose she is afraid the
girl will fall out, or else the lever is stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The automobile was now a good distance down
the road, and running dangerously close to the
stone fence. Then it swayed to the other side,
two wheels going into some mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; the lady shrieked, at some
cadets standing near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Jack on the bicycle!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, he is going after the auto!&rdquo; put in
Pepper.</p>
<p>Along the road swung the ponderous machine,
the lady continuing to call for help, and the little
girl crying in her terror. Behind, Jack was doing
his best to catch the runaway machine.</p>
<p>It was a stiff race, and for several minutes it
looked as if the young cadet would not make it.
But at last he closed the gap ahead, and came up
directly behind the automobile. Then, with a
quick leap, he cleared the bicycle handle bars and
caught hold of the back seat of the turnout ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked, as he piled
forward. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stop it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the lever is stuck!&rdquo; gasped the woman.
She was on the point of fainting through excitement
and fear.</p>
<p>Jack bent down, and his knowledge of automobiles
stood him in good stead. He saw how
the lever had become bent. With all of his might
he tugged upon it, and brought it back. At once
the automobile began to slacken its pace. Then
came another pull, and the ponderous machine
came to a complete standstill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured the lady, and sank back in
a deathlike swoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Annie is dying!&rdquo; shrieked the
little girl. &ldquo;Oh, dear, I never want to ride like
this again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t dying,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll soon
be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked back and saw some of the cadets
hurrying along the road. Soon Pepper came up,
followed by Andy and a dozen others, and then
Captain Putnam put in an appearance.</p>
<p>The lady was lifted from the automobile and
carried to a shady spot under a tree. She had
smelling salts with her, and was treated with
these, and her face was bathed with water from
the brook. Soon she opened her eyes and stared
around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are safe, madam,&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;Pray take it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jennie, my niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is safe too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fearful ride I have had,&rdquo; went on the
lady, with a shudder. &ldquo;It was awful! The auto
got entirely beyond my control. Where is the
brave young gentleman who stopped it for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam,
pointing to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you! Why, you&mdash;er&mdash;you are the
young man that&mdash;that had the trouble with my
husband a few days ago,&rdquo; faltered the lady, and
reddened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that,&rdquo; said Jack, quickly.
He remembered what the lady had said on that
occasion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I happened to be on the
bicycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sprang from the wheel into the
machine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a brave thing to do. I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later a buggy came along, being
driven furiously by the man who owned the automobile.
He leaped out and ran toward his wife
and his little niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they hurt?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Carl, we are not hurt,&rdquo; answered his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you run off so furiously,
Annie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. The machine
started up, and I could not stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That young soldier saved us, Uncle Carl,&rdquo;
came from the little girl. &ldquo;He rode on his wheel
after us, and jumped into our auto and pulled on
the handles till it stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at Jack, and his face grew red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;did you&mdash;er&mdash;you stop the auto
for my wife?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered the young major, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did it at the risk of his life, too,&rdquo; added
the lady. &ldquo;Carl, we owe him a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face became a study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo; he asked at length.
&ldquo;Tell me the story, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; And Jack did
so, and then the lady had her say, and so did Captain
Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It was
handsome of you, handsome. And after I
treated you so meanly, too! Say, do you know
how I feel? I feel like two cents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us drop it,&rdquo; said Jack, and walked away.
But the man came after him, and his voice was
full of emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go off that way. I want to tell you
something. I&mdash;I acted like a fool the other day.
It wasn&rsquo;t fair at all. And now you&rsquo;ve done the
handsome thing. It was great, simply great! I
thank you, and I ask your pardon at the same
time. Won&rsquo;t you shake hands?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; cried Jack, and held out his
hand, which the other grasped tightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
right&mdash;only please give us a little more show
when we&rsquo;re on the march after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have the whole road&mdash;you deserve
it!&rdquo; answered the man, heartily. &ldquo;This has
taught me a lesson I&rsquo;ll not forget,&rdquo; he added, as
he turned back to look after his wife and inspect
the automobile. It took some time to repair the
big machine, and in the meantime the cadets
walked away, and Jack delivered the wheel to the
owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a great ride of yours,&rdquo; said the boy.
&ldquo;And that jump into the auto was grand. Do
you know that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Carl Reuterman. He is a rich
brewer. He runs all over these roads, and he is
rather careless. But I guess he&rsquo;ll be more careful
after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to be&mdash;or he and his family will
get into trouble,&rdquo; returned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he reward you, Jack?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t want any reward,&rdquo; answered
the young major. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t risk my neck for pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The march back to school came to an end that
evening at seven o&rsquo;clock. A hot supper awaited
all hands, and the manner in which the students
pitched in was astonishing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have cold weather now,&rdquo; said
Pepper, on turning in. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a heavy frost
on the ground already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frost will be good for the nuts,&rdquo; came from
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; put in Henry Lee. &ldquo;Let
us organize a nutting party. I know where we
can get a lot of nuts. The trees are just loaded
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m ready any time Captain Putnam
will let us off,&rdquo; came from Jack. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t believe he will let us off this week, on account
of the outing we have already had,&rdquo; and
he was right.</p>
<p>The cold weather continued, and there was a
promise of snow in the air. The week passed,
and on the following Saturday the master of the
Hall said all of the pupils could go out in the
woods for three hours, if they wished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must be careful of two things,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Do not get lost, and do not poach on
private grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get lost,&rdquo; said Andy. He
had been out in the woods a number of times.</p>
<p>The boys divided up into half a dozen parties,
and set off with light hearts. Each party carried
bags for nuts, and Jack had a pocket compass, in
case his party should miss the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Just after they had started Dale came to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter is going up to Top Rock Hill,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;I believe that is private property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going there myself,&rdquo; said the young
major, &ldquo;but not on private grounds. There
are a good many trees outside of the inclosures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager Baxter gets into trouble,&rdquo; said
Dale. And he was right, as later events proved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">THE RESULT OF THE NUTTING PARTY</span></h2>
<p>All the boys who accompanied Jack were
good walkers, and it was not long before they
were deep in the woods back of Putnam Hall.
The clear, bracing air put them in good spirits,
and more than one began to whistle as they went
on their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a barbed wire fence!&rdquo; cried Pepper,
as they began to ascend Top Rock Hill.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go over that, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a path to the left,&rdquo; answered Andy.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know but what it is the better of
the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not long after that they struck the first nut
tree. They sent up a dozen sticks and stones, and
down came a perfect shower of chestnuts, so
thick in fact that they had to &ldquo;stand from under&rdquo;
until the nuts stopped coming down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve struck a bonanza, first trip,&rdquo; cried
Dale. &ldquo;This will fill one-third of our bags at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>They began to pick up the nuts industriously,
and soon had the majority of them. Then they
passed on up the hill and soon found another tree
almost as good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the very top of this hill,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;We are sure to get a beautiful view from
up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the time being nutting was forgotten, and
they raced along, to see who should get to the
top of the hill first. But Dale outdistanced the
others with ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use talking, Dale, you are the champion
runner of Putnam Hall!&rdquo; cried Jack, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;If we had a game of hare and hounds
you ought to be the hare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no hounds would ever catch him,&rdquo; put in
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, but running makes a chap hungry!&rdquo;
came from Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some chestnuts,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here are a few to start on,&rdquo; came from
Pepper, and he let several fall down the hungry
youth&rsquo;s back, inside his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Let up!&rdquo; ejaculated Stuffer, squirming
around. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! They&rsquo;ll scratch me all the
rest of the day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stand on your head and shake them out,
Stuffer,&rdquo; suggested Jack, and in the end that was
what the hungry youth had to do. But he got
square that night by placing some chestnut burrs
in Pepper&rsquo;s bed, much to the Imp&rsquo;s discomfiture.</p>
<p>The top of the hill gained, a grand panorama
was spread out on all sides of them. To the
westward were other hills, with streams winding
along them, and to the eastward Putnam Hall
and the broad lake, the latter lying like a sheet of
silver among the trees and rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Do you know,
I wish we had brought a camera along. I&rsquo;d like
a photo of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can come up some day and take pictures,&rdquo;
replied Andy. &ldquo;The folks at home will
be glad to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, look over there!&rdquo; came from
Stuffer, a moment later. &ldquo;Am I mistaken, or is
that Dan Baxter and his party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure it is Baxter, Paxton, and
Mumps,&rdquo; answered Jack. He gazed a moment
longer. &ldquo;What are those men doing to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men have sticks, and one has a gun!&rdquo;
exclaimed Pepper. &ldquo;As sure as you are born,
Baxter and his cronies are in trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went into private grounds, that&rsquo;s what
the trouble is, and those men have caught them,&rdquo;
said Dale. &ldquo;Just the same, fellows, I&rsquo;d hate to
see any of our cadets come to harm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter will earn what he gets, Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us sneak closer and see what is being
done,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to see
anybody shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was agreed, and with their bags of nuts
over their shoulders they hurried in the direction
where they had located the bully and his
cronies.</p>
<p>As they surmised, the party had poached on a
private preserve, and the owner of the place, a
hot-tempered old gentleman from Syracuse, and
his three workmen, had caught them red-handed,
with their bags loaded with the choicest kind of
nuts.</p>
<p>To their consternation the old gentleman at
first threatened to shoot the evil-doers, at which
Mumps fell on his knees and begged for mercy.
Then he ordered them to place all their nuts in a
heap on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll let you off on one condition,&rdquo; he
said, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What condition?&rdquo; asked Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll do anything!&rdquo; howled the sneak of
the Hall. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t have me arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the three of you will pick for me a full
bushel of nuts I will let you all go,&rdquo; said the
owner of the preserve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grumbled Baxter. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
satisfied to rob us of those we have already
picked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot rob you of what is already mine,
young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick nuts for you,&rdquo; said Mumps, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; added Paxton, humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not pick any more,&rdquo; came from the bully,
defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I&rsquo;ll have you sent down to
the Cedarville jail. I don&rsquo;t think Captain Putnam
will like that, or your parents, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mean thing&mdash;to send a fellow to jail
for a few nuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw my signs, and when you came in
here you did it at your own risk. Men and boys
have been hunting, fishing, and nutting in here
until I am tired of it, and I shall make an example
of you, unless you agree to do as I wish. I make
this offer merely out of friendship for Captain
Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to pick any nuts,&rdquo; came firmly
from Dan Baxter. He had on an extra stubborn
streak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. Mike and John, make him
a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Without ceremony two of the workmen leaped
forward and caught hold of the bully. He tried
to resist, but in a twinkling one of the workmen
laid him flat on his back. Then his hands were
tied behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; he roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep quiet or you&rsquo;ll get a sound thrashing,&rdquo;
ejaculated the gentleman, whose temper
was none of the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make you pay for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll do a little paying for yourself,
unless you wish to serve a term in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this there came a spell of silence, during
which Paxton and Mumps piled up as many nuts
as they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want your names,&rdquo; said the gentleman, taking
out a note-book and a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is John Fenwick,&rdquo; said the sneak, humbly.
He felt there would be no profit in acting
ugly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now yours, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick Paxton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I want yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I won&rsquo;t give it to you,&rdquo; returned the
bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! Mike, did you bring that horsewhip
along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did that, sur,&rdquo; answered the workman addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to horsewhip me!&rdquo; cried
Baxter, and now for the first time he turned pale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then give me your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry Smoker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um! I believe I heard one of the others call
you Dan,&rdquo; said the gentleman, sharply.</p>
<p>To this the bully was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, give me your correct name&mdash;or it shall
go hard with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, if I help pick nuts will you let me
off?&rdquo; said the bully, after an awkward pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is too late now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reply disconcerted the bully greatly, and he
did not know what to say further. He had a
vision of being taken to the Cedarville jail, and
it caused him to shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rough on Baxter,&rdquo; whispered Jack,
he and his chums having come closer during the
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he brought it on himself,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;The captain warned him not to go on
private property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could easily do as Mumps and Paxton are
doing,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;They are getting off
easily enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not long after this the gentleman that owned
the preserve told Paxton and the sneak of the
Hall that they might quit gathering nuts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let this be a lesson to you, John Fenwick and
Nicholas Paxton,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;I shall
keep your names before me, and if I ever find you
here again it shall go hard with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go?&rdquo; questioned Mumps, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to desert me?&rdquo; cried Dan
Baxter, in fresh alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want them to go, and at once,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
&ldquo;I can take care of your case without
their aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little more talk followed, and then Paxton
and Mumps shoved off, in the manner of two
whipped curs, leaving the bully of Putnam Hall
to his fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we ought to try to rescue Baxter,&rdquo;
whispered Jack to his chums. He was too generous-hearted
to see any fellow cadet in trouble
without trying to aid him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you attempt it,&rdquo; put in Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Baxter is put in jail it will bring discredit
to the whole school, Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we can do,&rdquo; came from Pepper.
&ldquo;To get to Cedarville, the owner of this
place will have to take the Rumley Road. Let us
get back to the Hall and tell the captain what is
going on. Perhaps he can stop the party on the
way to Cedarville and make a deal with the man
who wants to have Baxter arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea! Come on!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>With their bags of nuts on their shoulders,
Jack and his friends hurried away, down the hill
and along the highway leading to Putnam Hall.
Before they reached the school they had to take to
a side road, and along this they fairly ran, so that
they might not be too late with their news. As
luck would have it, they came upon the master of
the Hall just as the latter was returning from a
visit to the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Putnam, we have news!&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;Dan Baxter is in trouble, and a man is
going to take him down to Cedarville to have
him jailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter in trouble?&rdquo; repeated Captain Putnam.
His face grew serious. &ldquo;Tell me the particulars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As well as they were able, they did so. The
master of the Hall took in what they said in silence
and his face grew stem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure Paxton and Fenwick were allowed
their liberty?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I&rsquo;ll meet Mr. Ringwood, and see
what I can do about this. I am glad you told me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t wish to see any of the cadets put
in jail,&rdquo; came from Jack. &ldquo;It would bring discredit
to the whole school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Major Ruddy. I&rsquo;ll go out
to meet Mr. Ringwood at once, and you can go
along if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">OUT IN THE COLD</span></h2>
<p>It was not long after this that our friends and
Captain Putnam reached the main road leading
from Top Rock Hill to Cedarville. Scarcely had
they done so than they saw a carriage coming
along the road, containing Mr. Ringwood, Dan
Baxter, and two of the workingmen from the preserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; cried Jack, and the captain
ran out in the middle of the road and motioned
for the carriage to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, is that you, Captain Putnam?&rdquo; called
out Mr. Ringwood, in a far from pleasant tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Mr. Ringwood, and I wish to talk to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one of your students here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad egg, captain. I caught him stealing
my nuts. After that he was impudent to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t impudent,&rdquo; grumbled the bully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just heard about it and I came out to meet
you,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
drive over to the Hall, and we&rsquo;ll try to settle this
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish it, captain. I had half a mind
to have the young rascal arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no need to do that, Mr. Ringwood.
I think I can punish him sufficiently for
what he has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; I&rsquo;ll drive over.&rdquo; And in a
moment more the carriage was headed for Putnam
Hall, and the captain and our friends
trudged after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go now, young gentlemen,&rdquo; said
the master of the Hall. &ldquo;If I wish you again,
I&rsquo;ll call for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a hint that they were not wanted, and
off they went, across the campus and into the
school by a side entrance, the others entering by
the front way and going directly to Captain Putnam&rsquo;s
private office.</p>
<p>It was not until the next day that they learned
something of what happened to Dan Baxter.
From Peleg Snuggers the information went forth
that the bully of the Hall was a close prisoner in
a small room at the rear of the Hall. The window
to this room was heavily barred, making the
apartment a regular prison cell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The captain give Baxter a talkin&rsquo; to which
would make your hair curl,&rdquo; said the general
utility man. &ldquo;He laid down the law good an&rsquo;
strong. He said he wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to have no pupil
a-gittin&rsquo; the academy in disgrace. Then he made
Crabtree put him in a cell, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; on
bread, soup, an&rsquo; water fer a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! That&rsquo;s pretty severe punishment!&rdquo;
cried Jack. &ldquo;The captain must have been
mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You git the cap&rsquo;n riled up real good an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
see a reg&rsquo;lar cyclone broke loose,&rdquo; went on Snuggers.
&ldquo;I know him, because I worked fer the
fam&rsquo;ly before. He&rsquo;s real tame alongside o&rsquo; what
he was when he was an army officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mumps and Paxton had little or nothing to
say. Each was given extra lessons to do, and did
them without a murmur. They saw that the captain
was much disturbed over what had happened
and did not want to do anything to add to his
anger.</p>
<p>Two days after the outing for nuts, came a
light fall of snow, and then the weather grew
steadily colder and colder. As a consequence,
many outdoor games came to an end, and the
students spent their off time either in the library
of the Hall or the gymnasium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>The latter place was a favorite with Dale, who
was beyond question the leading all-around athlete
of the school. He was graceful on the rings
and bars, and could jump and run with the best
of them. The only one who could match him at
all was Andy, who did things on the flying rings
which would have done credit to a professional
acrobat or gymnast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, you could go into a circus,&rdquo; said Jack,
after watching the agile youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will go into a circus some day,&rdquo;
answered Andy, seriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that
some daring fellows earn two or three hundred
dollars per week at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; put in Pepper. &ldquo;But they risk
their necks every time they perform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can do some of those
tricks,&rdquo; put in Joe Nelson. &ldquo;As you do them,
they seem as easy as pie, but when I try them, I
can&rsquo;t do them at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I was born to it,&rdquo; answered Andy,
with a quiet smile. &ldquo;Somehow it always came
natural to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have circus blood in your veins,&rdquo; said
Pepper, and then there was a general laugh.</p>
<p>In his cell, Dan Baxter passed day after day
in moody silence. He was allowed only his school
books, and each day Josiah Crabtree or George
Strong visited him to hear him recite. Only once
did Coulter manage to see him on the sly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mumps and Paxton can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Gus
Coulter. &ldquo;They are being watched night and
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have deserted me, and they gave me
away!&rdquo; growled the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they haven&rsquo;t deserted you,&rdquo; answered
Coulter. &ldquo;And they didn&rsquo;t tell on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did tell on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Ruddy, Pepper Ditmore, Andy Snow,
and that crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of this, Gus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve got an account to settle with them
when I get out,&rdquo; and the bully grated his teeth.
He did not stop to consider that those who had
informed on him had probably saved him from a
term in the Cedarville jail.</p>
<p>During those days spent by Baxter in his cell,
Jack, Pepper, and Andy, along with a number of
other students, had an exceedingly hard time of
it with Josiah Crabtree. For some reason or
other, the head teacher was feeling particularly
cross, and he vented his anger on those under
him, until they could scarcely stand it. He made
them do all sorts of extra tasks, and &ldquo;nagged&rdquo;
at them until some felt like open rebellion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s outrageous!&rdquo; declared Andy. &ldquo;Here
I&rsquo;ve got ten extra examples in algebra for nothing
at all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And just because I dropped my history on the
floor, old Crabtree made me stay in half an
hour,&rdquo; grumbled Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught it, too,&rdquo; came from Jack. &ldquo;I
missed in astronomy and had to study five pages
extra. Mr. Strong or the captain never treated
us that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had another teacher in old Crabtree&rsquo;s
place,&rdquo; came from Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam can&rsquo;t discharge him,&rdquo; said
Joe. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a contract, so Stuffer was telling
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could duck him in the lake. The
cold water might do him good,&rdquo; went on Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;It would
certainly cool him off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day Captain Putnam was called away to
Albany on business. As it chanced, George
Strong was also absent, so the Hall was left in
sole charge of Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be more dictatorial than ever now,&rdquo;
said Pepper, and so it proved. During the day
over a dozen students got into &ldquo;hot water,&rdquo; and
at recess they held a secret meeting, to determine
what had best be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only get him out of the building
we might keep him out,&rdquo; suggested Andy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
going to be a cold night, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>This idea took like wild-fire, and it was resolved
to get Josiah Crabtree out of the building
by all means. Only the faithful were let into the
secret, and they watched the teacher narrowly
after the school session came to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to do it,&rdquo; said Pepper. And he
unfolded his plot, to which the others listened
eagerly. They saw Crabtree walk through a side
hallway, and immediately hurried to a spot just
around the corner from where the teacher was
standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll meet at the gym to-night, at exactly
ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Pepper in a loud voice.
&ldquo;Be sure and be on hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;the gym at ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said
Andy, in an equally loud voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a
fine spread!&rdquo; And then the boys ran off before
Josiah Crabtree could stop them.</p>
<p>The crabbed teacher heard what was said, and
as soon as the cadets had vanished his face took
on a crafty look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gymnasium at ten o&rsquo;clock, eh?&rdquo; he
murmured to himself. &ldquo;A fine spread, eh? Not
if I know it! Josiah Crabtree, you must capture
them, and make an example of them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>As the captain and Mr. Strong were away, he
enlisted the services of Peleg Snuggers. It may
be mentioned here that the other teachers came
only during school hours, one living at Cedarville,
and others coming but twice a week, to
teach music and foreign languages.</p>
<p>At the proper time that night all of the pupils
but Pepper and Andy went to bed. The latter
hid themselves in the hallway, one near
Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s room, and the other one downstairs.</p>
<p>At a quarter to ten the teacher came forth from
his room, wearing his regular school suit. As the
gymnasium was only across the campus, he did
not feel it necessary to don his overcoat. He
slipped to the rear of the school, summoned Peleg
Snuggers, and both left the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone!&rdquo; cried Andy, and rushing forward
from his hiding place he locked the door.
Then he and Pepper saw to it that all of
the other doors and also the windows were
secured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll fix them better than that,&rdquo; said
Jack, and secured small wedges of wood. These
were driven under the doors, and alongside of the
window sashes, so that they could not be opened
without great effort.</p>
<p>By this time fully a dozen of the cadets were
out of their dormitories. Pepper and Andy went
around summoning the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We want your aid,&rdquo; said Pepper, boldly.
&ldquo;Old Crabtree has gone outside and we mean to
keep him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody in favor of keeping him out raise
their hands,&rdquo; called out Andy, and fully sixty
hands went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton, what do you say?&rdquo; asked Jack. He
knew Nick Paxton was the leader of the Baxter
crowd during the absence of the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying anything,&rdquo; growled Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try to let Crabtree in,&rdquo; came from
one cadet. &ldquo;We are going to let him have a
regular freeze-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Gus Coulter had had trouble with the
teacher, he was willing to keep the man out, and
so, after some talk, it was decided that nobody
should aid in letting the teacher get into the Hall
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anybody tries it, he&rsquo;ll catch it good and
hard,&rdquo; warned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us!&rdquo; shouted a score of
others. &ldquo;No sneak wanted here!&rdquo; And some
glanced at Mumps in a fashion that made that
youth slink out of sight in short order.</p>
<p>Going to an upper window, Pepper, Andy, and
Jack looked out, and saw Crabtree and Snuggers
stealing softly around the gymnasium. After a
look into several of the windows, the two men
crouched down behind some bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the best yet!&rdquo; whispered Pepper.
&ldquo;They think we haven&rsquo;t arrived yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them wait,&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;It will cool
them off sure. It is nipping cold to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">THE BOYS &ldquo;HOLD THE FORT&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Quarter of an hour passed, and still Josiah
Crabtree and Peleg Snuggers remained in the
vicinity of the gymnasium, while the boys, from
behind the window shades, watched all of their
movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are cold enough,&rdquo; was Dale&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;See them slapping their arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the crabbed teacher could stand it no
longer. Leaving the general utility man to remain
on guard, he started back for the Hall at a
brisk pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is coming!&rdquo; whispered Jack. &ldquo;Now,
boys, don&rsquo;t make a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the door, Josiah Crabtree tried the
knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Who could have locked that?&rdquo; he
asked of himself. &ldquo;Certainly I did not. Snuggers
must have the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t got no key an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t lock the door,
Mister Crabtree,&rdquo; said the hired man, on being
questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is certainly locked now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nobuddy come here neither,&rdquo; said Peleg
Snuggers. He was growing tired of waiting
around in the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try the other doors,&rdquo; came from Josiah
Crabtree, and he hurried off once more. Of
course he found everything tight shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has locked us out,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;It must have been those boys. Perhaps they
saw Snuggers and myself going to the gymnasium.
Confound the luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he walked around the Hall, trying all of
the doors, and when he had done so, called to
Snuggers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have locked us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josiah Crabtree pondered for a moment and
then, walking back to the main door of the Hall,
pulled the bell.</p>
<p>Ordinarily the bell pealed loudly, but now no
sound came forth, for the clapper had been bent
back by one of the cadets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! they have disconnected the bell!&rdquo;
growled Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;The young scamps!
I&rsquo;ll fix them for this! Just wait till I get inside.&rdquo;
And then he began to thump on the door with
his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting warmed up,&rdquo; whispered Andy,
grinning broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, it will keep his blood in circulation,&rdquo;
answered Jack, and all of the cadets
present snickered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to open that door?&rdquo; roared
Josiah Crabtree, at last. &ldquo;You young villains,
open the door, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but he&rsquo;s getting complimentary, I must
confess,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the noise will wake up Mrs.
Green?&rdquo; asked one of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she sleeps like a cow,&rdquo; answered another.
&ldquo;Besides, her room is at the top of the building,
and all of the upper doors are shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; bellowed Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; echoed Peleg Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we answer?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; returned Pepper. &ldquo;Wait till he
tries to break in. Then I&rsquo;ve got another scheme
to work on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding he could do nothing at the door, Josiah
Crabtree hurried to one of the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, is your chance!&rdquo; cried Stuffer.
&ldquo;A little water from one of the pitchers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; came from Hogan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bath
he&rsquo;s afther nadin&rsquo;, sure!&rdquo; And up the stairs he
bounded. Water pitcher in hand, he approached
a window over the one the teacher was trying to
open. Then down came the water on the teacher&rsquo;s
head, wetting him thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; roared Josiah Crabtree, and began
to dance around. &ldquo;Oh, the water has gone down
my back! It&rsquo;s ice-cold! Oh, I&rsquo;ll pay you for
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no payment requoired!&rdquo; said
Hogan, softly, and closed the window again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerald, you&rsquo;re a gem!&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t old Crabtree feel fine with a wet back on
such a bitter night as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t let me in I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have the law
on some of you!&rdquo; yelled Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;This
is&mdash;er&mdash;preposterous! Open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the winders is tight shut,&rdquo; said Peleg
Snuggers, who had been making an examination.
&ldquo;I must say, I dunno how we are to git in, Mr.
Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get in,&rdquo; fumed the teacher. &ldquo;Why,
my back feels like a&mdash;er&mdash;an icicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I stay out here I&rsquo;ll catch my death of
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idee, sir. I might get a ladder
and put it up to the second-story winders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Get the ladder at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general utility man hurried off to the carriage
house and presently came forth carrying a
long ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I can do to lift it, sir,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to help me raise it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a ladder!&rdquo; whispered Jack.
&ldquo;They are going to try to get into one of the upper
windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on upstairs,&rdquo; returned Pepper. &ldquo;Say,
has anybody got a blank cartridge left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several had, having saved them from the encampment,
and they were passed over to Pepper,
who placed one in his gun. Then Andy loaded
up likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on your caps, boys,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Pull
&rsquo;em down over your eyes, so Crabtree can&rsquo;t recognize
us in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was also done, and a score of students
crowded into the room which the teacher and
Snuggers expected to enter.</p>
<p>They had scarcely done so when there came an
unexpected crash. In trying to raise the heavy
ladder both Josiah Crabtree and Snuggers had
allowed it to slip, and the end came through the
window sash, shattering the window panes into a
thousand pieces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! That&rsquo;s the time they did it!&rdquo; exclaimed
Henry Lee. &ldquo;There will be some glass
to pay for when this adventure is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that wasn&rsquo;t our fault,&rdquo; came from
Harry Blossom. &ldquo;They should have been more
careful with the ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snuggers, have a care!&rdquo; roared Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;You have broken the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twasn&rsquo;t my fault!&rdquo; howled the hired man.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you keep her from slippin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold the bottom of the ladder while I go up,&rdquo;
ordered the teacher, ignoring the question. &ldquo;Be
careful now. I don&rsquo;t want to break my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-holdin&rsquo; tight enough,&rdquo; grumbled the
hired man.</p>
<p>With caution Josiah Crabtree started to come
up the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the burglar, boys!&rdquo; shouted
Pepper, in an assumed voice. &ldquo;He has broken
the window. He deserves to be shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! shoot the burglar!&rdquo; came in a
shout. &ldquo;Shoot him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll teach &rsquo;em that they can&rsquo;t rob Putnam
Hall even if Captain Putnam is away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; screamed Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;I am
no bur&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take careful aim,&rdquo; commanded Pepper,
loudly. &ldquo;All ready?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I am no bur&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I command you to sto&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bang! bang! bang! went three of the guns, the
cadets shooting high up into the night air. With
a wild scream of terror, Josiah Crabtree slid
down the ladder, on top of Peleg Snuggers&rsquo; head,
and both sank to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes Mr. Burglar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away, you robber! If you don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll
give you another dose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor head!&rdquo; groaned Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are shooting at me!&rdquo; moaned Crabtree,
scrambling up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be takin&rsquo; us for burglars!&rdquo; went on the
general utility man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two of them,&rdquo; came from above.
&ldquo;Shoot them, fellows! They must be regular
desperadoes to try such a game as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us run!&rdquo; screamed Peleg Snuggers, and
set off at his best pace, with Josiah Crabtree at
his heels. Neither stopped until he was safe in
the shelter of the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go!&rdquo; laughed Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
wager they won&rsquo;t come back in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shove the ladder off,&rdquo; commanded Jack, and
this was done, the ladder falling out across the
campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;ll come back,&rdquo; came from
Dave Kearney. &ldquo;What shall we do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; there is plenthy av water,&rdquo; suggested
Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket. Put the guns away, or we
may arouse Mrs. Green after all, or somebody
living at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guns were restored to the racks on the
lower floor of the Hall, and this done, two students
stationed themselves at each window upstairs,
each with a pitcher of cold water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where somebody is going to get a
fine ducking,&rdquo; said Bart Conners, with a merry
twinkle in his eyes. Bart did not do much talking,
but he was as full of mischief as the average
cadet.</p>
<p>Soon they saw Josiah Crabtree and Peleg
Snuggers sneaking toward one of the lower windows.
The hired man had an ax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They surely mean business this trip,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper. &ldquo;Give it to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down went one pitcherful of water after another,
and in a trice both the teacher and the
hired man were thoroughly drenched. They set
up a howl, and Snuggers dropped the ax as he
ran off with Crabtree by his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we had about enough?&rdquo; questioned
Jack, after a wild burst of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed, and be as mum as oysters,&rdquo;
said Andy, and this was agreed to. All of the
upper windows were closed, and then some of the
cadets unlocked the door below that had been
open, and fixed the door bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, not a word from anybody, on his
life!&rdquo; said Jack, and the word spread rapidly.
Inside of five minutes every cadet was in bed, the
lights were put out, and all became as silent as a
tomb inside of Putnam Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">JOSIAH CRABTREE IS NONPLUSED</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to do next, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; stammered the enraged
teacher. He gave a shiver. &ldquo;I am wet
to the skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; came from Peleg Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be after gitting the rheumatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am half of a mind to invoke the aid of the
law,&rdquo; went on Josiah Crabtree, stalking around
the barn to keep himself warm. &ldquo;This is preposterous,
outrageous, extraordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blessed shame, sir, that&rsquo;s wot it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange that Mrs. Green was not
aroused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t, sir&mdash;she&rsquo;s a heavy sleeper. She
sleeps with an alarm clock on a chair beside her
bed, to wake her up in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snuggers, we must get into the school building
in some manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go around to the front once more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want another duckin&rsquo;, sir. It was terribul,
that was!&rdquo; And the general utility man
shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can get under the shelter of the
doorway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the barn once more, and sneaking
around the campus, came at last to the front of
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the door&rsquo;s on a crack!&rdquo; ejaculated the
hired man. &ldquo;I thought it was locked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was locked!&rdquo; returned Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;Can it be possible that the rascals have left the
building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Crabtree, perhaps they are after us
with them guns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so. Anyway, let us get inside.
Then we can lock the door on them. Some
of the cadets must have gone crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two passed into the Hall, and the teacher
lost no time in locking and bolting the door. All
was pitch-dark, and Josiah Crabtree scarcely knew
what to do next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see nuthin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was Peleg Snuggers&rsquo;
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not to be expected without a light,&rdquo; answered
the teacher, sarcastically. &ldquo;Have you a
match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then light up, and I&rsquo;ll try to get to the bottom
of this piece of villainy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain we ain&rsquo;t in danger o&rsquo; bein&rsquo;
shot?&rdquo; queried the hired man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light up, I tell you!&rdquo; thundered the teacher.</p>
<p>The hallway was soon a blaze of lights. Nothing
appeared to be out of its place, and Josiah
Crabtree passed from one classroom to the next,
and then to the messroom, the kitchen, and to
Captain Putnam&rsquo;s private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have gone!&rdquo; murmured Snuggers, and
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are either outside or upstairs,&rdquo; answered
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;Come, we will go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better get a club&mdash;or somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this,&rdquo; answered the teacher, and
brought forth a heavy ruler. Then he gave the
hired man a cane, and both mounted to the second
floor of the Hall. Here all was as dark as it had
been below, and again Snuggers was called on to
light up.</p>
<p>Without further hesitation Josiah Crabtree
pushed open the door of Dormitory No. 1. A
glance inside showed him all of the cadets in
bed, apparently fast asleep. He scratched his
head in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I dreaming, or is this a trick?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are the rascals there?&rdquo; queried Peleg Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These&mdash;er&mdash;cadets seem to be asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us look in the next dormitory,&rdquo; said
Crabtree.</p>
<p>This was done, and then the other sleeping
rooms were visited. Not a bed was found vacant,
and all of the boys looked as if they were
sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snuggers, am I awake?&rdquo; demanded the
teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you are, sir. I know I ain&rsquo;t asleep&mdash;an&rsquo;
I ain&rsquo;t dry nuther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you make of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, unless they be a-playin&rsquo; off on you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you recognize any of those who&mdash;er&mdash;attacked
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were attacked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were doused with water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;very cold water at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we were fired upon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;I heard the bullets whistle past our
heads, sir,&rdquo; added the hired man, drawing on his
imagination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet all of these cadets are asleep&mdash;or
pretend to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery, sir, that&rsquo;s wot it is, sir. But
what&rsquo;s to do?&rdquo; and the general utility man
scratched his head.</p>
<p>For once in his life Josiah Crabtree was nonplused.
He rubbed his chin and cleared his
throat several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought they were playing off on
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have all been in it, sir,&rdquo; interrupted
Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. But that&rsquo;s the
point&mdash;I do not know which to accuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better change our clothes an&rsquo; go
to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may change your clothes, and I&rsquo;ll do the
same. But I am going to investigate further before
I retire for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair separated, and Peleg Snuggers lost
no time in getting to his room. Josiah Crabtree
stalked to his own apartment and there proceeded
to don dry clothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The head teacher was furious, but the more he
mused over the problem before him, the more was
he perplexed. He could not call all of the boys
to account, and, to tell the truth, he was just a
bit afraid of the whole school. With Captain
Putnam and George Strong absent, there was no
telling what the pupils might do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get shot, or something like
that,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Perhaps I had better
wait until the captain gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me again?&rdquo; came presently
from Peleg Snuggers, from outside the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can go to bed. But sleep with one
ear open, in case there are more disturbances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; good-night, sir,&rdquo; and the general
utility man tiptoed away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t catch me
a-gittin&rsquo; up again to-night,&rdquo; he muttered to
himself. &ldquo;One sech duckin&rsquo; is enough fer
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy he has given up the battle,&rdquo; said Pepper
to his chums, after a long spell of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is afraid of us.&rdquo; came from Andy.
&ldquo;Those shots frightened him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager we hear something in the morning,&rdquo;
put in Jack. &ldquo;We ought to bind every
fellow to absolute secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;We can visit
every dormitory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>This plan was agreed to, and soon a dozen cadets
were making the rounds, and each student
was made to promise on his honor not to say a
word concerning the doings of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me catch you opening your trap and I&rsquo;ll
make it warm for you,&rdquo; said Jack to Mumps, and
the sneak promised faithfully to keep mum.</p>
<p>In the morning the cadets were on hand as
usual, and they came down to roll call as if nothing
out of the ordinary had happened. Josiah
Crabtree was on hand, looking as dark as a thunder
cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew, but his face is enough to sour the
milk!&rdquo; whispered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, he is watching us,&rdquo; returned Pepper,
and then the chums became silent.</p>
<p>Nothing was said during breakfast, and it was
not until the school was assembled for the first
session of the day that Josiah Crabtree opened
up upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night a most disgraceful thing happened
at this academy,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;A number of headstrong
pupils locked me out of this building, and
attacked me with their guns. I have some information
concerning this affair, but I am bound
to get at all the details. I, therefore, demand that
each pupil tell all he knows of the affair. I shall
ask each pupil by roll order. Dale Blackmore,
what have you to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; answered Dale, rising.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know anything of this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say,&rdquo; returned the cadet,
stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um! Sit down. Harry Blossom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, sir,&rdquo; answered Harry,
as he arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bart Conners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; answered
the captain of Company B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Augustus Coulter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Coulter arose, Jack, Pepper, Andy, and a
number of others eyed him sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know anything much,&rdquo; stammered
Dan Baxter&rsquo;s crony. &ldquo;I was&mdash;er&mdash;very
sleepy last night. I heard some noise, but I
didn&rsquo;t pay any attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; returned the teacher, sarcastically.
&ldquo;You must have slept very sound, indeed, not to
have heard the gun-shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t so bad for Coulter,&rdquo; whispered
Jack to Pepper.</p>
<p>One after another the pupils were questioned,
but all had nothing to say. Even Mumps said
&ldquo;Nothing to say!&rdquo; in a voice that was as stiff
as starch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid of his life,&rdquo; whispered Andy. &ldquo;I
told him he&rsquo;d be treated to an icy bath if he said
two words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;School will come to order!&rdquo; thundered Josiah
Crabtree, after the name of the last cadet had
been called out. &ldquo;I shall inquire into this later on.
We will now take up our studies for the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beaten!&rdquo; said Jack, and the young
major spoke the truth. Try his best Josiah Crabtree
could not get at the bottom of the mystery,
and at last he had to give it up, for fear of being
ridiculed by Captain Putnam and George Strong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">BURIED UNDER THE SNOW</span></h2>
<p>One morning the cadets of Putnam Hall
awoke to find the ground covered with snow.
The storm had started in about midnight, and
was still raging, the wind sending the flakes
whirling in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the snow!&rdquo; shouted Andy, as he
rushed to one of the windows to look out. &ldquo;Pep,
this is glorious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; came from the Imp. &ldquo;Oh, but won&rsquo;t
we have a dandy time snowballing each other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And building a snow house,&rdquo; put in Stuffer.
&ldquo;I love to build a snow house, and after it&rsquo;s all
done, we can put benches inside, and a little table,
and have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to eat,&rdquo; interrupted Jack.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t you going to say that, Stuffer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;but how did you guess it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got a way of knowing things,&rdquo; returned
the young major. &ldquo;But this is grand and
no mistake. Somehow, a good old snowstorm
always makes me feel jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Pepper was at the window, and opening it a
few inches he brought in a handful of snow. Gazing
around he saw that Henry Lee was still sleeping
peacefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he whispered, and going up to
Henry laid the soft snow directly over his mouth.
&ldquo;Hi, wake up!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Henry started, and opened his eyes. Then he
started to speak, when some of the snow dropped
into his mouth, and he commenced to splutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what&mdash;who&mdash;gug&mdash;gug&mdash;who put
snow in my mouth?&rdquo; he gasped, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Henry!&rdquo; sang out Pepper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see how it&rsquo;s snowing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you needn&rsquo;t try to fill me up with
it, Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, you&rsquo;re missing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly Henry Lee arose and started to dress
himself. Then Pepper turned away. Like a
flash Henry ran to a window, got some snow, and
whacked it on Pepper&rsquo;s neck, allowing some to
run down the Imp&rsquo;s backbone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great mackerels!&rdquo; howled Pepper. &ldquo;Let up!
I&rsquo;ll turn into an icicle!&rdquo; And he began to dance
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;you don&rsquo;t want to miss the
benefits of the storm,&rdquo; said Henry, calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>The cadets were soon below, and snowballs
flew fast and furious across the campus. All of
the boys were happy, and all too soon they had to
go in to breakfast and then take up their
studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish old Crabtree would come outside during
recess,&rdquo; murmured Pepper to Jack. &ldquo;Maybe
we wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing to him, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know better than to show himself,&rdquo; answered
Jack, and he was right, the teacher kept
indoors all day.</p>
<p>But George Strong came out, and took a snowballing
in good part. He even threw a few balls
himself, showing that his aim was as good as any
of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the kind of a teacher to have,&rdquo; was
Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;A fellow can&rsquo;t help but take
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snow continued all of that day, and by
nightfall was nearly a foot deep. It was very
blustery, and in some spots the drifts reached up
to one&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will make traveling bad,&rdquo; said Jack, and
he was right. On the roads in that vicinity horses
with their turnouts could scarcely get through.</p>
<p>Poor Peleg Snuggers came in for his full share
of the snowballing. As soon as the general utility
man appeared, he was bombarded from all sides,
and had to run for his life.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="center"><span class="small">POOR PELEG SNUGGERS CAME IN FOR HIS FULL SHARE OF THE SNOWBALLING.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let up, please let up!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;You
ain&rsquo;t fer killin&rsquo; an old man, be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow will do you good, Peleg. It will
make you grow,&rdquo; sang out Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make you handsome,&rdquo; put in Dave
Kearney. &ldquo;You want to be handsome, don&rsquo;t you,
Peleg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will teach you how to dance,&rdquo; came from
Harry Blossom. &ldquo;See, he is dancing already.&rdquo;
And Peleg was dancing, with pain, for a big
snowball had just landed in his left ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I knowed it!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;The
minit the snow comes, there ain&rsquo;t no rest fer me.
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to resign!&rdquo; And then he rushed for
the barn.</p>
<p>On the following day the sun shone brightly,
and this caused the snow to pack down. A dozen
of the boys set to work to build a snow house and
a fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be the biggest house yet,&rdquo;
announced Pepper. And he and his chums
worked with a will. They kept at it during all of
their spare time for two days, and when done the
top of the house was fifteen feet high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a regular snow palace,&rdquo; cried Andy.
&ldquo;Let us stick a flag on the top.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you are going to get it up
there,&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;If you climb up, now
the windows are cut out, you&rsquo;ll cave in the
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; said Andy, and ran off to get
a small flag which they had had on their tent during
the brief encampment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pepper and Harry Blossom
were inside of the snow house, leveling off the
flooring with their shovels. Jack went off to get
a bench, and Dale to get a stool.</p>
<p>Having procured his flag, Andy crawled up on
the top of the house with care and placed it in
position. Then he came down and went around
to the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our colors are up,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Say,
it&rsquo;s all right in here,&rdquo; he added, looking around.
&ldquo;A fellow could live in here if he had to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, since the Esquimaux live in snow
huts,&rdquo; returned Harry. &ldquo;It might prove pretty
cold, unless a fellow could start up a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the friends were talking, Dan Baxter
came up, accompanied by Paxton and
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, look at the snow house!&rdquo; exclaimed
the bully. &ldquo;Let us make one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we can make a better one than this,&rdquo;
growled Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, let us cave it in on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; whispered
Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Baxter, eagerly. &ldquo;How
shall we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all run up to the top. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy had gone into the house, to aid Pepper
and Harry, and nobody was near. Looking
around, to make sure they were not observed,
Baxter, Paxton, and Coulter ran up on the snow
house and began to jump up and down. There
came a crack, several others, and then with
scarcely a sound the top of the snow house went
down, burying the boys above up to their knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of this!&rdquo; exclaimed Baxter, and
pulled himself free, followed by his cronies. Soon
they were clear of the snow and running across
the campus.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Jack re-appeared,
followed by Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, the house has caved in!&rdquo; ejaculated
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is under the snow,&rdquo; came from
Dale. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the end of that shovel
moving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever is in there will be smothered to
death, if we don&rsquo;t get him out,&rdquo; went on Jack.
&ldquo;Come, get the snow out of the way as fast as
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>The pair set to work, and in a moment more
several other cadets were helping them. Then
somebody ran off and called George Strong, who
came to the spot on the double-quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we must get them out at once,&rdquo; said
the assistant teacher. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take much to
smother a person under the snow. Work lively,
boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did work lively, throwing the snow on
all sides. The teacher worked with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out that you don&rsquo;t hurt somebody with
your shovels,&rdquo; said Jack, cautiously.</p>
<p>Soon he caught sight of a foot and then a leg.
He began to pull, and George Strong aided him,
and up came Harry Blossom, almost black in the
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped the cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is under there?&rdquo; demanded George
Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy Snow and Pepper Ditmore,&rdquo; answered
Harry. &ldquo;Oh, get them out if you can! If you
don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll surely be smothered to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must get them out,&rdquo; came from Jack.
&ldquo;Come on&mdash;work harder than ever!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">A CHALLENGE ACCEPTED</span></h2>
<p>It was soon noised around the Hall that two of
the cadets had been buried alive in the snow, and
the whole school gathered around the collapsed
snow house, and as many went to work to dig out
Pepper and Andy as could get close enough.</p>
<p>On the outside of the crowd stood Baxter, Paxton,
and Coulter, and the face of each was pale
and full of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to end this
way,&rdquo; muttered Coulter, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; returned the bully, fiercely. &ldquo;Do
you want to be found out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;mum&rsquo;s the word,&rdquo; put in Paxton.
&ldquo;If we are found out, it may mean our dismissal
from the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if one or the other is dead&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Coulter
could not finish the sentence. Baxter clapped a
hand over his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, I say!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Not a word
more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>The workers had now gotten almost to the bottom
of the snow house. Presently they uncovered
the form of Pepper. Close beside him lay Andy.
Both were partly unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them air!&rdquo; ordered George Strong.
&ldquo;Get back, boys!&rdquo; And then the two sufferers
were laid out on the snow and several went to
work to revive them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope they get over it!&rdquo; murmured
Jack. He could not bear to think of anything
serious happening to his chums.</p>
<p>For several minutes all were in doubt. Then
Pepper began to move, and Andy gave a faint
gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are reviving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven for that!&rdquo; murmured Jack.</p>
<p>A little later the two sufferers sat up and stared
around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, Pepper?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. The&mdash;the house came
down on our heads, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember now,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;It
came down awful sudden like, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel anyway ill, boys?&rdquo; questioned
George Strong, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m weak in the knees,&rdquo; answered Pepper,
and Andy said the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll carry them into the Hall,&rdquo; said Jack,
and soon the two sufferers were made comfortable
indoors. Andy soon declared he felt as well
as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the snow house come to cave in?&rdquo;
questioned Jack, after the excitement had somewhat
subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;The roof
came down on us without warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fellows climbed up on the snow house,&rdquo;
put in Bart Conners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climbed up on it?&rdquo; queried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, three fellows. I saw it go down with
them. Then the three fellows ran away as fast
as they could go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were those three fellows?&rdquo; questioned
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. I had been down to the
lake looking to see if there was any clear ice
for skating. I was too far off to recognize
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! that explains it,&rdquo; murmured the
young major. &ldquo;The snow house was caved in on
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know who would be so mean!&rdquo;
exclaimed Andy. &ldquo;Those chaps must have
known that we were inside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they didn&rsquo;t think it would be anything
serious,&rdquo; came from Stuffer, who was near.
&ldquo;Maybe they got scared after it went down, and
then they ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news that three cadets had caved in the
snow house spread, and before the day was over
Captain Putnam did his best to locate the offenders.
But Baxter, Paxton, and Coulter said nothing,
and they were not exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a mean and serious trick to play,&rdquo;
said the captain, on addressing the scholars.
&ldquo;Had it not been for the prompt work done to
rescue those under the snow, one or more lives
might have been lost. I wish to hear of no more
such actions at Putnam Hall. If I learn who is
responsible I shall punish that party severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! we had a narrow escape,&rdquo; said Baxter,
when he and his cronies were safe in their dormitory.
&ldquo;Bart Conners saw us from the lake
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he didn&rsquo;t recognize us,&rdquo; added
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope no one else saw us,&rdquo; said Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we are safe. But we want to stop
talking of it, or somebody may overhear us,&rdquo;
said the bully; and there the subject was dropped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>On the following day the boys had a big snow
fight. Company A went into the snow fort to defend
it, while Company B did its best to capture
the stronghold. Andy and Pepper did not take
part, as Captain Putnam thought it best for them
to keep quiet. But the other lads went at the
fight with a will, and the contest lasted for three
hours, when the fort capitulated. During the
fight Stuffer was hit a heavy blow in the ear, and
Dan Baxter got a black eye from a &ldquo;soaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew who threw that soaker!&rdquo;
howled the bully of Putnam Hall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give him
something, and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Jack Ruddy threw it,&rdquo; said Mumps,
although he had no reason for such a statement.</p>
<p>During the fort fight Jack and Baxter had had
something of a row, and the bully was willing
enough to believe what the sneak said. When
Jack went down to the gymnasium after the fight
was over, the bully followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re smart to hit me with a
soaker,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;For two pins I&rsquo;d
knock you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was angry, too, and without answering he
took two pins from his coat lapel and held them
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo; blustered the bully. He
had not expected to have his challenge accepted
thus quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s cool answer. &ldquo;You are
itching for a thrashing, Baxter, and if you don&rsquo;t
shut up pretty quick you&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fight! A fight!&rdquo; cried several cadets, and
the news spread like wildfire that the young
major was going to fight the bully of Putnam
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter is too heavy for Major Ruddy,&rdquo; said
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack will be knocked out clean and clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Jack can do some
pretty good bag-punching,&rdquo; said another, which
was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight here, Jack,&rdquo; whispered Dale, who
was present. &ldquo;You are sure to be found out, and
then there will be a big row. Baxter wouldn&rsquo;t
like anything better than to see you lose your
majorship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not going to take his insults, Dale,&rdquo;
returned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then fight some other place. I know a good
spot. Down back of the bathing houses. There
is a clear space there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to fight?&rdquo; blustered Baxter,
doubling up his fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to, Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not here,&rdquo; broke in Dale. &ldquo;Come on
back of the bathing houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s a good spot!&rdquo; came from
several. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; And they hurried from
the gymnasium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon fight here,&rdquo; said the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have nothing to lose by being
found out,&rdquo; retorted Dale. &ldquo;Come on&mdash;unless
you are afraid.&rdquo; And he led Jack out of the
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a quitter, Baxter!&rdquo; cried several.
&ldquo;Come on&mdash;unless you really are afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of nobody in this school!&rdquo; roared
Baxter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight him here or anywhere he
wants. Just you see me do him up in no time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk is cheap,&rdquo; said Stuffer, who had come
up. &ldquo;After Jack is down and out I&rsquo;ll believe you,
not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was soon at a convenient spot behind
the bathing houses. Here the wind had
swept the snow from the ground. The word had
circulated thoroughly, and fully fifty cadets were
assembled to see the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch him closely, Jack!&rdquo; whispered Andy.
&ldquo;He may try to play you foul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on my guard,&rdquo; answered the young
major.</p>
<p>Each of the contestants took off his coat, and
likewise his collar. Then they faced each other;
and the all-important fight was on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">HOW THE FIGHT ENDED</span></h2>
<p>It must be admitted that Jack was a little in
doubt as to the outcome of the fight before him.
Dan Baxter was large, and was something of a
boxer and an athlete. In fact, he could fight better
than he could learn his lessons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go at him from the start, otherwise
he may wear me out,&rdquo; the young major told
himself.</p>
<p>With clenched fists the two cadets circled
around, each watching for a chance to deliver a
blow. Those watching the contest formed a
large circle, and numerous were the words of advice
given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land him a good one, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paste him hard, Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Baxter&rsquo;s fist shot out and landed on
Jack&rsquo;s breast, sending the young major back a
step or two. Then Jack sent in a blow on the
bully&rsquo;s arm. Next came several hits which were
of small consequence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to him good, Jack,&rdquo; came from Andy.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like that?&rdquo; cried the bully, and
hit Jack a stinging blow in the cheek.</p>
<p>It was just what was needed to wake the young
major up. All of his real fighting blood leaped
to the surface, and an instant later he sent out his
fist on the bully&rsquo;s nose. Then, before Baxter
could recover, he hit out once more, and struck
Baxter on the chin, lifting him from his feet and
sending him on his back in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Jack has knocked Baxter down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; called out Paxton, and rushed to his
crony&rsquo;s assistance. He caught the bully by the
arm and dragged him to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you much hurt?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did&mdash;did he hi-hit me with?&rdquo; stammered
the fallen one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his fist,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;I reckon it
was hard enough, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He struck me with something else&mdash;a stone,&rdquo;
cried the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; ejaculated Jack. He held up
his open hands. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a thing but my fingers
and thumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Again the pair faced each other. Baxter was
in a rage, and after a few light passes he rushed
in and clinched. Around and around the ring
went the two cadets, each trying to get the better
of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break away!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;Break away!&rdquo;
But neither Jack nor Baxter paid attention. Baxter
had Jack bent far over and was hitting him on
the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; cried Andy, but scarcely
had he spoken when Jack ducked still lower, and
like a flash Baxter was raised in the air and
thrown over the young major&rsquo;s back. He came
down with a thud, and before he could get up
Jack was on top of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you give in, Baxter?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off of him!&rdquo; cried Paxton. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no
fair way to fight. Let him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let him up,&rdquo; came from Jack, and he
leaped up and away. Baxter sat up, stared
around, and arose slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried the young major. &ldquo;Unless
you have had enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix
you yet; see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Once more the pair went at it, hammer and
tongs. Blows flew thick and fast, but to the majority
of the boys it was easily to be seen that
Jack was getting the better of it. Baxter was
almost winded, and stood up with difficulty. He
felt that another blow or two would make him
fall. Watching his chance, he tipped a wink to
Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheese it! Here comes one of the teachers!&rdquo;
called out Paxton. &ldquo;Run for it unless you want
to be caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry was taken up on all sides, even though
nobody saw the teacher. At once Dan Baxter
stepped back and reached for his collar and coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you another time, Jack Ruddy,&rdquo; he
muttered, and hurried away before the young
major could reply.</p>
<p>Slipping on his own coat and adjusting his collar,
Jack gazed around and then, with his chums,
walked toward the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a fake, I believe,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton gave the alarm,&rdquo; came from Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter winked at him&mdash;I saw him do it,&rdquo;
said Stuffer. &ldquo;I guess he wanted to stop. He
was pretty dizzy. Another blow or two would
have finished him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll finish him some other time,&rdquo;
answered Jack. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t behave himself until
he is well whipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baxter did not stop until he reached his dormitory.
He sank into a chair, and, later on, bathed
his swollen face and eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pretty hard fighter,&rdquo; said Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! I am not afraid of him, Nick,&rdquo;
growled the bully. &ldquo;The truth is I&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t
have tried to fight to-day,&rdquo; he went on, lamely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not feeling well. My&mdash;er&mdash;my stomach is
all out of order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew there must be something the matter,&rdquo;
said Paxton, sympathetically. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hit
out like I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I&rsquo;m myself; I&rsquo;ll lay him out cold,&rdquo;
said the bully, boastingly.</p>
<p>But for the present he was content to keep out
of Jack&rsquo;s sight, and in public he said little about
the contest. Behind it all he was frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be careful how I go at him,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;He knows how to handle his fists
better than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the fight matters remained quiet for
some time to come. A brisk wind cleared some of
the snow from the lake, and the cadets spent a
large portion of their off time in skating. Some
of the cadets built themselves ice-boats, and had
not a little fun in sailing up and down the lake
shore. One ice-boat was the property of Dale
and Harry Blossom, and on an afternoon Coulter,
Paxton, and Mumps made off with the craft,
without asking permission to use it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I call nerve!&rdquo; Dale declared,
when he heard the news. &ldquo;Just wait till they get
back! I&rsquo;ll give them a piece of my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will I!&rdquo; added Harry. &ldquo;Our friends
can use the ice-boat if they wish, but not such
fellows as Paxton, Coulter, and Mumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets who had gone off with the ice-boat
did not know much about running such a craft,
although Mumps knew all about ordinary sailing
boats, having come from the Hudson River, as
previously stated. The wind carried the trio
out of sight of the Hall, and they sat down to
enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all right!&rdquo; said Coulter, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Nick, we ought to build a boat of our
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much labor,&rdquo; grumbled Paxton.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use, when you can get someone
else&rsquo;s craft for nothing?&rdquo; And he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be angry when they hear how we
went off,&rdquo; came from Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sailing with the wind was easy enough, and
soon several miles were covered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better turn around,&rdquo; said the sneak
of the school. &ldquo;Remember, it won&rsquo;t be near so
easy tacking back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t turn back yet,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
fine to spin along. Let her go!&rdquo; And on they
went for another mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi!&rdquo; shouted Coulter, suddenly. &ldquo;Look
ahead! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s open water!&rdquo; gasped Mumps. &ldquo;Stop
her! Lower the sail! We&rsquo;ll be drowned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As speedily as possible they lowered the sail
of the ice-boat. But the momentum carried them
closer and closer to the water, and at last they
had to jump out on the ice to try to save themselves.
All rolled over and over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! I&rsquo;ll drown!&rdquo; shrieked Mumps, when
he found himself in the water. He floundered
around, and so did his companions. Then Paxton
stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up&mdash;it&rsquo;s not deep,&rdquo; he called out, and
they stood up and found the water only up to
their waists. The ice-boat lay near, floating
around on its side. Not far off was the bank of
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birr! how cold!&rdquo; came from Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sa&mdash;say a wo&mdash;word!&rdquo; chattered
Mumps. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;can&mdash;can&rsquo;t get my br&mdash;br&mdash;breath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haul the ice-boat in,&rdquo; came from Paxton,
and in disgust they brought the craft to shore.
Here they huddled close together, shivering from
head to feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wi&mdash;wish we ha&mdash;had&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t ta&mdash;ta&mdash;ta&mdash;taken
the con&mdash;confounded bo&mdash;boat!&rdquo; chattered
Mumps. &ldquo;Oh, this is dreadful! I&rsquo;ll be
frozen stiff in another minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to get back?&rdquo; questioned Coulter.
&ldquo;If we sail back we&rsquo;ll be frozen to death
before we re&mdash;reach th&mdash;the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stared at each other in dismay. They
were in a pickle truly, and did not know how to
help themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">FRIENDS IN NEED</span></h2>
<p>While the boys were staring around helplessly,
and shaking from head to feet from the
cold, Coulter espied another ice-boat coming
along the lake shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us stop those chaps!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Come
on! Run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others needed no second bidding. Anything
was better than standing still, and they set
off at a dog-trot, and soon came up to the ice-boat.
It was a craft belonging to Bart Conners
and some of his intimates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; yelled Coulter, Paxton, and
Mumps. &ldquo;Stop! There is open water ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These cries were heard, and without hesitation
Bart Conners turned his craft into shore, allowing
it to slide deep into a snowdrift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! Why didn&rsquo;t we think to run our
boat ashore?&rdquo; muttered Coulter. Such a simple
move had never entered the heads of the ill-fated
trio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you fellows?&rdquo; demanded
Bart Conners. &ldquo;Why, you look frozen
to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&mdash;we are&mdash;al&mdash;almost!&rdquo; gasped Paxton.
&ldquo;Ca&mdash;can&rsquo;t you help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your boat go into the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a blanket, we&rsquo;ve been using it for a
seat,&rdquo; sang out a cadet in Conners&rsquo; crowd.
&ldquo;Wrap yourself in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my overcoat, Mumps,&rdquo; said another.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my sweater on and don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter, you can take my overcoat,&rdquo; came
from Bart Conners.</p>
<p>The three wet cadets were willing enough to
don the things handed out to them. But even
with these dry coverings all were intensely chilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump on and we&rsquo;ll take you back to the Hall
as fast as we can,&rdquo; said Conners. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful
to take a plunge in the lake in such weather as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lent you the ice-boat?&rdquo; asked a cadet in
the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;we&mdash;er&mdash;we only thought we&rsquo;d have a
bit of fun,&rdquo; stammered Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! if you took that boat without permission,
I guess you got paid for it,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>The ice-boat was turned back, and as speedily
as it could be done, they brought the craft up to
the Putnam Hall landing. Here they met Dale
and Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you fellows mean by running off
with our ice-boat?&rdquo; demanded Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mean piece of business,&rdquo; put in
Harry. &ldquo;You ought to be pounded good for
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold them now,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
been punished enough. They got a ducking in
the ice-cold water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ice-boat ran into the open water, and
they might have been drowned, only the water
wasn&rsquo;t deep enough,&rdquo; put in another cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the ice-boat now?&rdquo; questioned
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the open water near shore. I guess you
can pull her in by throwing a line over her,&rdquo; answered
Bart.</p>
<p>Like so many half-drowned rats, Paxton, Coulter,
and Mumps sneaked into the Hall, and up to
their rooms. The news soon circulated that they
had fallen into the lake, and Captain Putnam
ordered them to bed, and had Mrs. Green prepare
some hot tea for them. In the meantime
Dale and Harry took a ride on Bart&rsquo;s ice-boat,
and soon succeeded in hauling the overturned
craft to the firm ice once more. The ice-boat
was not damaged, and a little while later Dale
and Harry were sailing her as before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that teaches those fellows a lesson to
leave our things alone,&rdquo; said Dale, and it did
teach Coulter, Paxton, and Mumps a lesson, at
least as far as the ice-boat was concerned.</p>
<p>Following the adventure just narrated, came a
series of heavy snow-storms, which are remembered
even to this day at Putnam Hall. They
lasted over the holidays, and many boys who had
planned to visit their homes at Christmas had to
forego that pleasure. One party that left got
stalled on the cars just outside of Ithaca, and remained
in the snowdrifts for twenty-four hours.
Another party got as far as Cedarville, and after
remaining there one whole day returned to the
Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>That the cadets might not feel too blue because
they were snowed in, Captain Putnam allowed
them to do pretty much as they pleased during
Christmas week. A fine turkey dinner was
served on Christmas and on New Year&rsquo;s day,
and the boys had a great deal of sport in the Hall
and in the gymnasium. Captain Putnam allowed
them to have some private theatricals, and Jack,
Pepper, Andy, Dale, and several others gave a
two-act drama entitled &ldquo;The Boy from the
Country.&rdquo; Andy was the country boy who
comes to the city to seek his fortune, and Dale
played the part of an old lady who knows the
boy&rsquo;s rich uncle. The drama was full of fun,
and was well received. Before the drama came
a banjo solo by one of the cadets, and then
a duet by two of the cadets who could sing remarkably
well.</p>
<p>While the singing was going on, Pepper
noticed Dan Baxter sneaking behind the stage,
and pointed him out to Dave Kearney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is up to mischief,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to go on in the next dialogue. Won&rsquo;t you
watch him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will,&rdquo; answered Dave, and hurried
after Baxter. He was in time to see the bully
throw something on the floor, just at the places
where the actors and singers made their entrances
and exits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grease!&rdquo; murmured Dave Kearney, after
getting down and feeling of the stuff with his
fingers. &ldquo;How mean! The boys would look
fine, sprawling all over the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he had greased the floor Dan Baxter
slipped back to his seat in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; said Dave, running around to
those who were waiting to perform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful of what?&rdquo; demanded several.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of grease on the floor. If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;ll
go sliding from one side of the stage to the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the grease get there?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Baxter put it there&mdash;I saw him do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, he ought to be mobbed!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dirty trick!&rdquo; came from another student.
&ldquo;We ought to pay him back for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us pay him back to-night,&rdquo; suggested
Stuffer.</p>
<p>So it was agreed, and it was also settled that
nobody should say a word about the grease until
the proper time came. The performance went
on, each performer taking good care not to get
too much grease on his soles, and stepping out
with caution. At last the show was over, and
the final curtain went down amid great applause
and cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was as good as a professional show,&rdquo;
declared Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it was betther nor some professional
shows,&rdquo; put in Hogan. &ldquo;Wanct I wint to a
show in the country&mdash;a travelin&rsquo; troupe &rsquo;twas&mdash;an&rsquo;
they couldn&rsquo;t act fer a sour apple. The b&rsquo;ys
got ancient eggs, an&rsquo; the stage was a soight to see
afther thim players got out av town!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>The performance had lasted until half-past ten,
and as soon as it was over the majority of the
cadets retired to their dormitories. With the
crowd went Dan Baxter, much disgusted that his
joke had not turned out as he had anticipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose one of them found out about the
grease, and he told the rest,&rdquo; was the way he
reasoned. &ldquo;Hang the luck anyway! I don&rsquo;t
seem to be able to get square with that crowd, no
matter what I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baxter was tired, and it was not long before he
was in the land of dreams. How long he slept
he knew not, but of a sudden he awoke, to find a
handkerchief tied across his mouth. Then his
arms were tied to his sides, his feet were fastened,
and he was raised up out of bed by six persons
and carried from the dormitory.</p>
<p>He was not greatly frightened, because he
thought some of the others in the dormitory were
playing a joke on him. He tried to see the faces
of the cadets, but could not, for each of the party
had a big paper bag thrust over his head, with
two holes in front, for seeing purposes.</p>
<p>Baxter was carried downstairs to the lower
floor of the Hall. Then the party made its way
to a side door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Throw a blanket over him, fellows,&rdquo; said one
person, and then the bully was almost smothered.
The next instant he found himself out in the snow
and being carried toward the gymnasium. The
building was soon reached and the door opened.
Then the whole party went inside, and a lantern
was lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now set the prisoner up, and we will decide
his fate,&rdquo; said one of the masked cadets, and then
the bully was placed on an empty box. His heart
sank within him, for he felt that he was not
among friends, but among those who had good
cause to be his enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">THE PUNISHMENT OF A BULLY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, what do you intend to do with
me?&rdquo; asked Dan Baxter, as soon as he could
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punish you!&rdquo; came from all of the masked
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have tried to bully us,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You greased the stage at our entertainment,&rdquo;
answered another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always quarreling with us,&rdquo; put in
a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to run things to suit yourself,&rdquo; came
from a fourth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get Mumps to play the sneak,&rdquo; added a
fifth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the bully, and began to
turn pale. &ldquo;I want you to let me go. It&rsquo;s cold
here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel warm enough before we get
through with you,&rdquo; answered one of the masked
cadets, meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&mdash;you hurt me, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t threaten us, Baxter. If you do, we&rsquo;ll
treat you so much worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mean shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; said the leader of the
masked cadets&mdash;it was Jack. &ldquo;If you move, it
will be at the peril of your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the crowd withdrew to a corner, leaving
Baxter alone. The bully wanted to escape,
but he was afraid to try it. The masked cadets
held a consultation lasting several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;Just the
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do they intend to do?&rdquo; asked
the bully of himself. &ldquo;Something awful, I&rsquo;m
sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter, we have decided on your fate,&rdquo; said
one of the masked boys. It was Pepper, but he
disguised his voice well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to brand you first and then
march you out into the country, so that you can&rsquo;t
find your way back to Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brand me! March me away! Don&rsquo;t you
dare to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blindfold him first, fellows!&rdquo; came from
Andy, and the bully&rsquo;s eyes were quickly bound
tight with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now heat up that iron,&rdquo; came loudly from one
of the masked cadets. &ldquo;I think that a B on his
forehead will look beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to&mdash;to&mdash;put a B on me
for?&rdquo; asked Baxter, with a shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B stands for Bully, and that is what you are,
Dan Baxter. Hurry up with that iron, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The iron is getting hot!&rdquo; came from Dale.
He had stepped to one of the windows and
brought in a sharp-pointed icicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nos. 3, 4, 6, and 7 will hold him, while Nos. 1
and 2 perform the operation. No. 5 can remain
on guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you brand me, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the
bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! If you dare to cry out, we&rsquo;ll brand
you on the cheeks as well as the forehead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; roared the bully and started
to get from the gymnasium, bound as he was.
But they tripped him up with ease, and as he went
headlong, one cadet sat on his breast and another
on his legs, rendering him helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, the iron!&rdquo; called out Stuffer.
&ldquo;Brand him well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>The icicle was brought forward, and at the same
time one of the boys cut a little lock of hair from
his head and lit a match. Then the icicle was run
over Baxter&rsquo;s forehead in the form of the letter B.
At the same time the lock of hair was lit and the
smell of the burning hair was allowed to reach the
bully&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; yelled Baxter, squirming greatly.
&ldquo;Let up! Don&rsquo;t burn me! Oh, I&rsquo;ll be marked
for life! Oh, this is outrageous! Don&rsquo;t, I beg
of you! Please let me go! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do anything
if you&rsquo;ll only let up on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up now,&rdquo; whispered Jack. &ldquo;He may get
a fit! He is almost scared out of his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, the blanket and the old boots,&rdquo;
came from Andy, and the victim of the hazing was
provided with a big pair of old rubber boots and
a heavy horse blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rdquo; asked the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your long tramp into the country,&rdquo; was
the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go out into the country this
cold night! Let me go, please do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to beg, Baxter. You have been a
bad boy, and you must take your medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the law on you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>In a minute more the gymnasium door was
opened and the victim was marched outside. He
was well blindfolded, so that he could not see
where he was going. The masked cadets led him
into the woods, around the boathouse, and then
made half a dozen turns, so that Baxter was completely
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the old shanty,&rdquo; said Jack, in a loud
voice, when they came to a halt. &ldquo;Put him into
the garret and leave him.&rdquo; And then Baxter was
marched into the carriage house of Putnam Hall
and made to mount the ladder to the loft. Here
he was tied to a post, but in such a loose fashion
that he could get free with ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Baxter, listen,&rdquo; said Jack, still in an
assumed voice. &ldquo;You are probably four miles
from Putnam Hall. Don&rsquo;t try to get away, or you
may get into more trouble. To-morrow night
we&rsquo;ll come back and finish our job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stay here so long. It&rsquo;s cold and I&mdash;I
ain&rsquo;t got anything to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, make the best of it,&rdquo; was the cry, and
then the masked cadets scampered off, and a few
minutes later were safe in their dormitories in the
Hall.</p>
<p>With a sinking heart Dan Baxter listened to
them depart, and then gave a deep groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand this!&rdquo; he muttered to himself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful! And to think they branded
me, too. What will Paxton and the others say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>The loft was not a particularly cold place, for
the windows were tightly closed. Waiting to
make sure that the crowd had gone, he pulled
himself free from his bonds.</p>
<p>When he placed his hand to his forehead he
could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses.
He could feel nothing of the branding&mdash;his forehead
was not sore&mdash;it did not hurt! What could
it mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have tricked me!&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;What a fool I was to raise such a howl! How
they&rsquo;ll laugh at me for it! But it did feel just as
if I was being burnt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All was pitch-dark around him, for the masked
cadets had taken the lantern with them. He
stepped forward and ran into a low beam, giving
his forehead a severe bump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! Nothing fake about that!&rdquo; he muttered,
dancing around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be careful,
or I&rsquo;ll break my neck. Wonder how far I am
from the Hall and what sort of a place this can
be?&rdquo; He felt around and grasped some old
spider webs. &ldquo;Some half tumbled down shanty,
I suppose. Perhaps I&rsquo;d better make myself at
home until morning,&rdquo; and he crouched down and
hid himself in the old horse blanket. He remained
awake half the night, finally falling off
into a troubled doze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>When Baxter awoke it was early morning and
still dark. He felt cold from head to feet and
gave a shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give five dollars to be back at the Hall,&rdquo;
he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Wonder if I can walk
the distance before it gets too light? If any person
sees me on the road with the rubber boots and
this horse blanket they&rsquo;ll take me for a lunatic.&rdquo;
He gave a deep sigh. &ldquo;I suppose I must be two
miles away, at least. They said four, but maybe
they piled it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several times the bully thought of starting out
but gave it up, thinking he might lose his way;
but when it became lighter he took a look around
the loft and presently descended the ladder to the
ground floor of the carriage house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you tramp! Wot be you a-doin&rsquo; up there,
tell me that?&rdquo; cried a voice from the other end of
the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no tramp, sir,&rdquo; answered Baxter. &ldquo;I
am&mdash;Peleg Snuggers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t Master Baxter!&rdquo; ejaculated the
general utility man, who had just started in on his
morning work. &ldquo;Well, I never! How did you
git here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What place is this, Peleg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot place? Why, the carriage house, o&rsquo;
course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; yelled Dan Baxter; and at that instant
he was by far the maddest boy the school
ever contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Wot did you think it was, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Is the back door to the Hall
open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going in,&rdquo; answered the bully, and
ran off without another word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE RESULTS OF A FIRE</span></h2>
<p>That morning Dan Baxter did not appear and
it was reported that he was sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acts to me as if he were going to die,&rdquo;
announced Mumps, when appealed to. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know exactly what is the matter with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; asked Pepper of Jack.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to think that Baxter got sick through
what we did to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely he is shamming,&rdquo; said the
young major, and he was right. But to make
sure Captain Putnam sent for Doctor Framley,
a physician of Cedarville, who made a careful examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is nervous, as if he had been frightened,
that is all,&rdquo; announced the medical man. &ldquo;Let
him keep quiet for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baxter had hoped to scare his tormentors into
thinking that they were responsible for a serious
spell of sickness. When this plan failed he
quickly got around as before. He tried his best
to find out who had hazed him, but the cadets kept
their secret well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>On the day following the hazing Jack chanced
to go down to the lake front. He was just entering
the boathouse when, to his astonishment, two
men stepped forth. They were the individuals
he had seen several times on the mysterious
sloop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what do you want here?&rdquo; he demanded,
but instead of replying the men hurried away, up
the lake, and then in the direction of Cedarville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the mysteries I ever struck,&rdquo; exclaimed
the young major. &ldquo;Now, what can those
chaps be up to? This is at least the third or
fourth time they have come here, and nobody
seems to know anything about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jack returned to the Hall he lost no time
in visiting Captain Putnam&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll laugh at me, sir,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But I want to report those two men again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; cried the master of Putnam Hall.
&ldquo;Where did you see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the boathouse. I went down there for a
skate strap. They were just coming out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you speak to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I asked them what they wanted. They
didn&rsquo;t answer, and hurried away on the Cedarville
road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they take anything out of the boathouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must assuredly investigate this, Major
Ruddy. Let us go to the boathouse together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done and they took a careful look
around. Nothing was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we follow them up once?&rdquo; questioned
Jack. &ldquo;We ought to be able to overtake
them in a cutter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea. I&rsquo;ll have Snuggers get a cutter
ready at once. Get your overcoat and your
gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes they were on the way, the
captain driving and Jack sitting by his side.
They drove all the way to the village, but saw
nothing of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they turned off on a side road,&rdquo; said
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to return to Putnam
Hall. This they did; and for the time being
the subject was dropped.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, Jack, Pepper, Andy,
and Dale got permission to visit Cedarville, one
to buy a pair of skates, and the others to get
various things. They set out on foot, thinking
nothing of the rather long walk before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Just before reaching Cedarville they came to a
side road, leading to a spot called Brierroot
Grove. A short distance up the road was a two-story
cottage, located behind a hedge of boxwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Andy, pointing to the cottage,
&ldquo;Am I mistaken, or is that place on fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the chimney smoking,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a fire coming up through the roof
around the chimney!&rdquo; burst out Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the fire!&rdquo; sang out Dale, and
suiting the action to the word, he turned down
the side road, and the others followed at his
heels.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the cottage the place
was burning fiercely throughout the second story
and around the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anybody,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Perhaps
the place isn&rsquo;t occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe tramps set it on fire,&rdquo; suggested Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see two men!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Well, I
never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men from the sloop! Here is where
they must have been putting up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets ran into the yard of the house and
to the front door. They had seen the two men
pass in and out, carrying some furniture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did this start?&rdquo; called out Pepper to
one of the men.</p>
<p>At this cry both men turned around to gaze
at the youths. Then one spoke to the other in
a low tone, and off they ran to the rear of the
cottage, leaped a rail fence, and disappeared
from view in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; yelled Jack, but the men paid no attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the queerest chaps I ever met!&rdquo; declared
Pepper. &ldquo;I believe they must be crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; came in a weak cry from the
cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is in there!&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a woman,&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
And he ran into the cottage.</p>
<p>The others followed. The smoke was growing
thick, and at first they could see nothing.
Then they saw an old woman with a crutch, trying
to hobble down a pair of stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me burn up!&rdquo; she screamed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me burn up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running to the old woman, Jack caught her in
his arms. It was an easy matter to carry her to
the open air. Here he sat her down on an old
horse-block which was clear of snow. She was
trembling so she could not speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>It was easily to be seen that the cottage was
doomed. The village of Cedarville boasted of
nothing better than an old hand engine and a
bucket brigade, and to get the engine through the
snow was next to impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take out what furniture we can,&rdquo; said
Jack, and this they did, and also carried out some
clothing, a lamp and a few pictures. While the
building was burning a crowd of thirty or forty
folks collected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t belong to the old woman,&rdquo; said one
of the farmers to Jack. &ldquo;It belongs to Mr. Eggers,
a rich man of Ithaca. He let her live in it
rent-free, because it wasn&rsquo;t worth much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the old woman didn&rsquo;t lose much,&rdquo; replied
the young major. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name is Mrs. Cowen. Nobody knows
much about her, except that she has a brother
who lives near the head of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman was taken to the nearest cottage,
and there, after the fire was at an end, Jack
went to interview her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to live with my brother now&mdash;I
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to live alone no more,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got out most of your furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twasn&rsquo;t mine&mdash;it belonged to the house.
The old hair trunk was mine. Did ye save
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t care much&mdash;brother Jim wants
me anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know about those two men who
were stopping at the cottage,&rdquo; went on Jack.
&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! It&rsquo;s just like &rsquo;em. They were the
strangest! Allers doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; queer-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they board with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of&mdash;when they were to home. They
went out a good deal. They each paid three
dollars a week. Sometimes they got their own
meals, too&mdash;when I wasn&rsquo;t feelin&rsquo; well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know their names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; one was Bart an&rsquo; tudder Paul.
They had some scheme for getting a million dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They were after a fellow they called
George. They said he had the secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they were crazy,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;Have you any idea where they could have gone
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman could tell no more, and a little
later Jack left her, and told his chums of what he
had learned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the fellows will leave the neighborhood,
now the house has burned down,&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must watch out for them,&rdquo; put in Andy.
&ldquo;They ought to be captured and interviewed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">THE DISAPPEARANCE OF GEORGE STRONG</span></h2>
<p>Two days after the fire came another snow-storm,
which lasted the best part of a day and a
night. After that the weather cleared rapidly,
and it became quite warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Malville,&rdquo; said George Strong,
on Monday afternoon. &ldquo;I shall be back early in
the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Strong,&rdquo; answered Captain
Putnam.</p>
<p>Malville was a small settlement back of Top
Rock Hill, and George Strong said he had a distant
relative there, whom he wished to see. He
set off in a cutter, and Jack and Pepper chanced
to see him depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good time, Mr. Strong!&rdquo; shouted
Pepper, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Ditmore, I am going on business,
not pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>The following morning passed, and the assistant
teacher did not appear. Captain Putnam
took his place in the classroom, and also taught
during the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strange,&rdquo; he said to Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;I expected him back by ten o&rsquo;clock, or noon at
the latest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day passed, and still George Strong
did not show himself, nor did he send any message
to explain his absence.</p>
<p>Captain Putnam was much worried, and the
absence of the assistant upset matters in the
school. All of the cadets began to talk of the
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe his horse ran away and threw him out
on the rocks,&rdquo; said Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was the captain I&rsquo;d investigate,&rdquo; came
from Harry Blossom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he was going on business,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Perhaps the business took longer than
he expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another day passed, and both the master of the
hall and his cadets grew worried. Josiah Crabtree
was very sour, for he had to perform some
of the duties assigned to the missing teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should have sense enough to come back,&rdquo;
said he severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong, that is certain,&rdquo; answered
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;I am going to investigate
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>When the boys heard that the captain was going
to drive to Malville Jack, Pepper, and Andy
begged to be taken along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can be of assistance,&rdquo; suggested
the young major. &ldquo;That is, if anything has
happened to him on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll take the big sleigh and a team,
and you can accompany me,&rdquo; answered the captain.</p>
<p>In the end the party to go out numbered five,
for Dale went along also. The team was powerful,
and in spite of the hills and the snow Malville
was reached in three hours. They found the
cottage of George Strong&rsquo;s relative, and were surprised
to find it locked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody has been at home for a month,&rdquo; said
a neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of a man with a cutter
around here yesterday, or a day or two
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have seen him, had he stopped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Our family generally see everything
that is going on around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neighbor could tell no more, and Captain
Putnam and the cadets were nonplused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have gone somewhere!&rdquo; declared
Pepper. &ldquo;The question is, where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us ask the folks around town if they have
seen him?&rdquo; suggested Dale.</p>
<p>This was done, and at last they met a blacksmith
who had seen George Strong on the road
a mile outside of Malville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was stopping by the roadside, and two
odd-looking men were talking to him,&rdquo; said the
blacksmith. &ldquo;They seemed to be arguing about
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; burst out Jack. &ldquo;Tell us how those
men looked, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blacksmith did so, and they listened with
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mysterious men, I&rsquo;ll wager a biscuit!&rdquo;
burst out Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I think,&rdquo; came from Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what the old woman
told you?&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;She said those
chaps were talking about a man named George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Those men must have been hanging
around Putnam Hall because Mr. Strong
was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets looked at Captain Putnam, whose
face was a study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right, my lads,&rdquo; said the master
of the Hall, slowly. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t explain
what the men wanted of Mr. Strong, or where
Mr. Strong has gone to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied of one thing,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;Those men were up to nothing good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they robbed Mr. Strong of something,
and threw his body into the snow,&rdquo; suggested
Dale.</p>
<p>They listened to all the blacksmith had to say,
and then took him along, so that he might point
out the exact spot where the interview had taken
place. It was near a turn in the road, where the
snow had drifted but little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are many footprints,&rdquo; said Pepper,
pointing with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if there might have been a
struggle,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;See how the
snow is dug and scattered about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look as if something had been going
on,&rdquo; answered the captain. &ldquo;See, the footprints
lead along this path and into the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the tracks of the horse and cutter!&rdquo;
shouted Dale, who had wandered down the road.
&ldquo;They go into the woods, too. Do you know
what I think? I think those men either killed
Mr. Strong, or made him a prisoner, and then
they carried him off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us follow the tracks of the cutter,&rdquo; said
Jack, and this was done; the blacksmith accompanying
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty business,&rdquo; said the blacksmith.
&ldquo;If those odd-lookin&rsquo; men killed your teacher
they ought to be hung fer it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tracks of the horse and cutter led into the
forest, and then along a cliff overlooking a stream
now thickly covered with ice and snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a little shanty!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over yonder at the edge of that next cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke is coming from the chimney,&rdquo; said
Dale, an instant later. &ldquo;That shows somebody
must be in the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us approach with caution,&rdquo; came from
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;There is no telling how
those strange men will act if they are there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better cut a few sticks,&rdquo; suggested Jack, and
got out his jackknife. They soon had sticks,
and the blacksmith cut a good-sized club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they be des&rsquo;prit characters they&rsquo;d better
give me a wide berth,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Slowly they drew closer to the shanty. Just to
the rear of the building was an open shed, and
here they saw the cutter, with the horse tied in a
corner and blanketed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shame to leave a horse out in such
weather as this!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men must be in the shanty,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam. &ldquo;I sincerely trust that we find Mr.
Strong unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us slip up behind the trees,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;We ought to try to capture them, or something,
on the sly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With caution they crept up behind the trees,
and then walked slowly toward the shanty. Some
bushes helped to screen them, and soon they stood
at the very door to the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is talking!&rdquo; whispered Jack.
&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first they heard only a murmur, but presently
they made out what was being said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, George, it&rsquo;s a million and nothing
less!&rdquo; one of the strange men was saying. &ldquo;A
million, eh, Bart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million!&rdquo; came from the other man. &ldquo;A
million, and all in cash, too! We want no bonds
or stocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stocks?&rdquo; one of the mysterious men laughed
harshly. &ldquo;Stocks? Do you want me to become
poor again? Cash! It&rsquo;s cash we want,
George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an easy time we can have on a million!&rdquo;
returned the other queer individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would only listen to reason!&rdquo; came
from George Strong. &ldquo;I do not know what has
put this into your head. I haven&rsquo;t a million dollars,
or anything like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have!&rdquo; came from both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are acting very foolishly, Bart. And so
are you, Paul. That failure has turned your
heads. If I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that money, and I am going to have
it!&rdquo; roared the man called Bart. &ldquo;Hand over
the million or I will shoot you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And drawing a pistol, he pointed it straight at
George Strong&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">A LUCKY ESCAPE&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Those men must be crazy!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe both of them are as mad as March
hares,&rdquo; returned Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>He tried the door, to find it locked. Putting
his shoulder to the barrier he burst it open, and
the whole party stormed into the shanty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Putnam!&rdquo; cried George Strong,
joyfully. &ldquo;I am very glad that you have
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put down that pistol!&rdquo; ordered the master
of the Hall, sternly, and looking the man named
Bart straight in the eyes. &ldquo;Put it down, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated an instant, and then allowed
the weapon to drop at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to shoot anybody,&rdquo; he said,
humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better give me the weapon,&rdquo; went
on Captain Putnam, and wrenched it from the
man&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! they are attacking us!&rdquo; shouted the
other man. &ldquo;Bart, we must fight for it!&rdquo; And
with a wild spring he leaped upon Jack, and
caught the young major by the throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le&mdash;let up!&rdquo; gasped Jack, and then he could
say no more, for his wind was completely cut
off. Then the other man began to fight, so that
the captain and the blacksmith had their hands
full trying to subdue him.</p>
<p>Seeing Jack&rsquo;s predicament, Pepper, Andy, and
Dale rushed at the fellow called Paul and dragged
him backward. But he would not let go his hold
upon the young major, and Pepper hit him over
the wrist with the stick. Then the man&rsquo;s hand
dropped, and Jack staggered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make him a prisoner!&rdquo; cried Andy,
and they caught the man and held him, while
Jack got a rope from the sleigh. Soon the other
man was also bound. George Strong had had
his hands tied behind him, and he was quickly
released.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know how thankful I am that
you came,&rdquo; said the assistant, warmly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
imagine things were getting black for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; thundered the man called Bart.
&ldquo;I want my million dollars!&rdquo; And he glared
wildly at George Strong and at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know these men at all?&rdquo; questioned
Captain Putnam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir. I am sorry to say they are distant
relatives of mine&mdash;third cousins. Both of them
used to be rich, but they went into an oil speculation,
and it failed, and they lost almost all of their
money. That seemed to turn their heads, and
somehow they got a notion that I was holding
back a family treasure from them, a treasure
they said was worth one or two million dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there such a treasure?&rdquo; asked Jack,
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, although the story is told
in our family that one of my ancestors, during the
Revolution, buried a pot of gold to keep the
English soldiers from getting it. But the amount
could not have been anything like a million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men were around the Hall a number
of times,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;They were the mysterious
fellows I mentioned a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they came to see me on the sly if they
could. I believe, had they gotten the chance,
they would have carried me off in their sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be put in an asylum,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;It is not safe to allow them
their liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission. I&rsquo;ll turn them over to
some of my relatives in the West,&rdquo; answered
George Strong. &ldquo;I know they can manage
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you please&mdash;but keep them away from the
Hall in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the two prisoners were furious, but
when their fury subsided they became very
humble, and both began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted only our rights,&rdquo; whined one.
&ldquo;If I had a million dollars, I could take an air-ship
to the North Pole or the moon, or anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly mad,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;What a
dreadful condition to be in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late in the day the prisoners were taken to
Cedarville, and George Strong telegraphed for a
relative to come at once and take charge of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be crazy, but they told me something
which I think may be true,&rdquo; said the assistant
teacher to the boys. &ldquo;They said they were
watching around the school at the time you
had the big snow house, and they saw three
cadets run up on top and cave it in. I questioned
them, and I am almost certain Coulter was one of
the boys and Baxter another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just like that crowd,&rdquo; exclaimed
Pepper, bitterly. &ldquo;If Baxter and Coulter were
in it the other fellow must have been Paxton or
Mumps,&mdash;I mean Fenwick, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said they were all big boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been Paxton. That crowd
always hangs together for mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they arrived at the Hall, Pepper
tried to locate the bully and his chums. The only
cadet he could find of the crowd was Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Coulter, it was you who helped to cave
in that snow house, eh?&rdquo; he said, catching the
cadet by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;er&mdash;told you,&rdquo; stammered Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denying it,&rdquo; was the bold reply.
&ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and hit Coulter a stinging
blow in the mouth, which loosened two front
teeth. Then a regular fight ensued, and Coulter
was badly whipped. Paxton also received a
thrashing at the hands of Andy, while Baxter
only escaped punishment by keeping out of sight
excepting during school hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, maybe, they&rsquo;ll keep their distance for
a while,&rdquo; said Pepper. But he was mistaken,
the bully of the Hall and his cronies were not
subdued, and what they did in retaliation will be
told in another volume, to be called &ldquo;The Putnam
Hall Rivals; or, Fun and Sport Afloat and
Ashore.&rdquo; In this book we will meet all of our
friends once more, in games and adventures as
exciting as any of the past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>George Strong felt much relieved when a relative
from the West came to take the two crazy
men away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never want to see them again,&rdquo; said the
assistant teacher. But he did see them, and they
did their best to cause him no end of trouble.</p>
<p>A week after the rescue of George Strong
some of the cadets learned that Captain Putnam&rsquo;s
birthday was at hand. They asked the master
of the Hall if they could celebrate, and he gave
the desired permission. Money was raised
among the cadets to present the captain with a
fine set of encyclopedias, and of this gift Captain
Putnam was justly proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things considered, you are doing very
well,&rdquo; said the master to his pupils. &ldquo;I am proud
of you, and happy to think that Putnam Hall is
earning such a good reputation for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t want to go to a better school,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;It just suits me exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say I,&rdquo; came from Pepper. &ldquo;Of course
we might do without Baxter and that
crowd&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every school seems to have its bully,&rdquo; put
in Andy. &ldquo;All we can do is to make him keep
his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with Baxter!&rdquo; broke in Dale.
&ldquo;Let us enjoy ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>Just then Stuffer burst into the dormitory, his
face wreathed in smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the mess-hall!&rdquo; he called out.
&ldquo;Such a spread! I&rsquo;m going to eat the meal of
my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;Hurry up,
all of you. If Stuffer gets there first, there will
be nothing left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they rushed down the stairs pell-mell; and
here let us leave them and say good-bye.</p>
